# Run a Stateless Application Using a Deployment

This page shows how to run an application using a Kubernetes Deployment object.

## Objectives

* Create an nginx deployment.
* Use kubectl to list information about the deployment.
* Update the deployment.

## Before you begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds?category=kubernetes&filter=all)
* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/public-playgrounds)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

Your Kubernetes server must be at or later than version v1.9.

To check the version, enter `kubectl version`.

## Creating and exploring an nginx deployment

You can run an application by creating a Kubernetes Deployment object, and you
can describe a Deployment in a YAML file. For example, this YAML file describes
a Deployment that runs the nginx:1.14.2 Docker image:

[`application/deployment.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/application/deployment.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy application/deployment.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

1. Create a Deployment based on the YAML file:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml
   ```
2. Display information about the Deployment:

   ```
   kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
   ```

   The output is similar to this:

   ```
   Name:     nginx-deployment
   Namespace:    default
   CreationTimestamp:  Tue, 30 Aug 2016 18:11:37 -0700
   Labels:     app=nginx
   Annotations:    deployment.kubernetes.io/revision=1
   Selector:   app=nginx
   Replicas:   2 desired | 2 updated | 2 total | 2 available | 0 unavailable
   StrategyType:   RollingUpdate
   MinReadySeconds:  0
   RollingUpdateStrategy:  1 max unavailable, 1 max surge
   Pod Template:
     Labels:       app=nginx
     Containers:
       nginx:
       Image:              nginx:1.14.2
       Port:               80/TCP
       Environment:        <none>
       Mounts:             <none>
     Volumes:              <none>
   Conditions:
     Type          Status  Reason
     ----          ------  ------
     Available     True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
     Progressing   True    NewReplicaSetAvailable
   OldReplicaSets:   <none>
   NewReplicaSet:    nginx-deployment-1771418926 (2/2 replicas created)
   No events.
   ```
3. List the Pods created by the deployment:

   ```
   kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
   ```

   The output is similar to this:

   ```
   NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   nginx-deployment-1771418926-7o5ns   1/1       Running   0          16h
   nginx-deployment-1771418926-r18az   1/1       Running   0          16h
   ```
4. Display information about a Pod:

   ```
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```

   where `<pod-name>` is the name of one of your Pods.

## Updating the deployment

You can update the deployment by applying a new YAML file. This YAML file
specifies that the deployment should be updated to use nginx 1.16.1.

[`application/deployment-update.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/application/deployment-update.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy application/deployment-update.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16.1 # Update the version of nginx from 1.14.2 to 1.16.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

1. Apply the new YAML file:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment-update.yaml
   ```
2. Watch the deployment create pods with new names and delete the old pods:

   ```
   kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
   ```

## Scaling the application by increasing the replica count

You can increase the number of Pods in your Deployment by applying a new YAML
file. This YAML file sets `replicas` to 4, which specifies that the Deployment
should have four Pods:

[`application/deployment-scale.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/application/deployment-scale.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy application/deployment-scale.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 4 # Update the replicas from 2 to 4
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

1. Apply the new YAML file:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment-scale.yaml
   ```
2. Verify that the Deployment has four Pods:

   ```
   kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
   ```

   The output is similar to this:

   ```
   NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   nginx-deployment-148880595-4zdqq   1/1       Running   0          25s
   nginx-deployment-148880595-6zgi1   1/1       Running   0          25s
   nginx-deployment-148880595-fxcez   1/1       Running   0          2m
   nginx-deployment-148880595-rwovn   1/1       Running   0          2m
   ```

## Deleting a deployment

Delete the deployment by name:

```
kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
```

## ReplicationControllers -- the Old Way

The preferred way to create a replicated application is to use a Deployment,
which in turn uses a ReplicaSet. Before the Deployment and ReplicaSet were
added to Kubernetes, replicated applications were configured using a
[ReplicationController](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/).
