# Indexed Job for Parallel Processing with Static Work Assignment

FEATURE STATE:
`Kubernetes v1.24 [stable]`

In this example, you will run a Kubernetes Job that uses multiple parallel
worker processes.
Each worker is a different container running in its own Pod. The Pods have an
*index number* that the control plane sets automatically, which allows each Pod
to identify which part of the overall task to work on.

The pod index is available in the [annotation](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations "A key-value pair that is used to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects.")
`batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index` as a string representing its
decimal value. In order for the containerized task process to obtain this index,
you can publish the value of the annotation using the [downward API](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/)
mechanism.
For convenience, the control plane automatically sets the downward API to
expose the index in the `JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX` environment variable.

Here is an overview of the steps in this example:

1. **Define a Job manifest using indexed completion**.
   The downward API allows you to pass the pod index annotation as an
   environment variable or file to the container.
2. **Start an `Indexed` Job based on that manifest**.

## Before you begin

You should already be familiar with the basic,
non-parallel, use of [Job](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/).

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds?category=kubernetes&filter=all)
* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/public-playgrounds)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

Your Kubernetes server must be at or later than version v1.21.

To check the version, enter `kubectl version`.

## Choose an approach

To access the work item from the worker program, you have a few options:

1. Read the `JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX` environment variable. The Job
   [controller](/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/ "A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state.")
   automatically links this variable to the annotation containing the completion
   index.
2. Read a file that contains the completion index.
3. Assuming that you can't modify the program, you can wrap it with a script
   that reads the index using any of the methods above and converts it into
   something that the program can use as input.

For this example, imagine that you chose option 3 and you want to run the
[rev](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rev.1.html) utility. This
program accepts a file as an argument and prints its content reversed.

```
rev data.txt
```

You'll use the `rev` tool from the
[`busybox`](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox) container image.

As this is only an example, each Pod only does a tiny piece of work (reversing a short
string). In a real workload you might, for example, create a Job that represents
the
task of producing 60 seconds of video based on scene data.
Each work item in the video rendering Job would be to render a particular
frame of that video clip. Indexed completion would mean that each Pod in
the Job knows which frame to render and publish, by counting frames from
the start of the clip.

## Define an Indexed Job

Here is a sample Job manifest that uses `Indexed` completion mode:

[`application/job/indexed-job.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/application/job/indexed-job.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy application/job/indexed-job.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: 'indexed-job'
spec:
  completions: 5
  parallelism: 3
  completionMode: Indexed
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      initContainers:
      - name: 'input'
        image: 'docker.io/library/bash'
        command:
        - "bash"
        - "-c"
        - |
          items=(foo bar baz qux xyz)
          echo ${items[$JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX]} > /input/data.txt
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /input
          name: input
      containers:
      - name: 'worker'
        image: 'docker.io/library/busybox'
        command:
        - "rev"
        - "/input/data.txt"
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /input
          name: input
      volumes:
      - name: input
        emptyDir: {}
```

In the example above, you use the builtin `JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX` environment
variable set by the Job controller for all containers. An [init container](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)
maps the index to a static value and writes it to a file that is shared with the
container running the worker through an [emptyDir volume](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir).
Optionally, you can [define your own environment variable through the downward
API](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/)
to publish the index to containers. You can also choose to load a list of values
from a [ConfigMap as an environment variable or file](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/).

Alternatively, you can directly [use the downward API to pass the annotation
value as a volume file](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/#store-pod-fields),
like shown in the following example:

[`application/job/indexed-job-vol.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/application/job/indexed-job-vol.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy application/job/indexed-job-vol.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: 'indexed-job'
spec:
  completions: 5
  parallelism: 3
  completionMode: Indexed
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: 'worker'
        image: 'docker.io/library/busybox'
        command:
        - "rev"
        - "/input/data.txt"
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /input
          name: input
      volumes:
      - name: input
        downwardAPI:
          items:
          - path: "data.txt"
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.annotations['batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index']
```

## Running the Job

Now run the Job:

```
# This uses the first approach (relying on $JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX)
kubectl apply -f https://kubernetes.io/examples/application/job/indexed-job.yaml
```

When you create this Job, the control plane creates a series of Pods, one for each index you specified. The value of `.spec.parallelism` determines how many can run at once whereas `.spec.completions` determines how many Pods the Job creates in total.

Because `.spec.parallelism` is less than `.spec.completions`, the control plane waits for some of the first Pods to complete before starting more of them.

You can wait for the Job to succeed, with a timeout:

```
# The check for condition name is case insensitive
kubectl wait --for=condition=complete --timeout=300s job/indexed-job
```

Now, describe the Job and check that it was successful.

```
kubectl describe jobs/indexed-job
```

The output is similar to:

```

      -c
      items=(foo bar baz qux xyz)
      echo ${items[$JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX]} > /input/data.txt

      /input from input (rw)

      rev
      /input/data.txt
    Environment:  <none>
    Mounts:
      /input from input (rw)
  Volumes:
   input:
    Type:       EmptyDir (a temporary directory that shares a pod's lifetime)
    Medium:
    SizeLimit:  <unset>

  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  4s    job-controller  Created pod: indexed-job-njkjj
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  4s    job-controller  Created pod: indexed-job-9kd4h
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  4s    job-controller  Created pod: indexed-job-qjwsz
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  1s    job-controller  Created pod: indexed-job-fdhq5
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  1s    job-controller  Created pod: indexed-job-ncslj
```

In this example, you run the Job with custom values for each index. You can
inspect the output of one of the pods:

```
kubectl logs indexed-job-fdhq5 # Change this to match the name of a Pod from that Job
```

The output is similar to:

```
xuq
```
