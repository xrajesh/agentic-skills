# Managing Secrets using kubectl

Creating Secret objects using kubectl command line.

This page shows you how to create, edit, manage, and delete Kubernetes
[Secrets](/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/ "Stores sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys.") using the `kubectl`
command-line tool.

## Before you begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds?category=kubernetes&filter=all)
* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/public-playgrounds)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

## Create a Secret

A `Secret` object stores sensitive data such as credentials
used by Pods to access services. For example, you might need a Secret to store
the username and password needed to access a database.

You can create the Secret by passing the raw data in the command, or by storing
the credentials in files that you pass in the command. The following commands
create a Secret that stores the username `admin` and the password `S!B\*d$zDsb=`.

### Use raw data

Run the following command:

```
kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
    --from-literal=username=admin \
    --from-literal=password='S!B\*d$zDsb='
```

You must use single quotes `''` to escape special characters such as `$`, `\`,
`*`, `=`, and `!` in your strings. If you don't, your shell will interpret these
characters.

> **Note:**
> The `stringData` field for a Secret does not work well with server-side apply.

### Use source files

1. Store the credentials in files:

   ```
   echo -n 'admin' > ./username.txt
   echo -n 'S!B\*d$zDsb=' > ./password.txt
   ```

   The `-n` flag ensures that the generated files do not have an extra newline
   character at the end of the text. This is important because when `kubectl`
   reads a file and encodes the content into a base64 string, the extra
   newline character gets encoded too. You do not need to escape special
   characters in strings that you include in a file.
2. Pass the file paths in the `kubectl` command:

   ```
   kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
       --from-file=./username.txt \
       --from-file=./password.txt
   ```

   The default key name is the file name. You can optionally set the key name
   using `--from-file=[key=]source`. For example:

   ```
   kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
       --from-file=username=./username.txt \
       --from-file=password=./password.txt
   ```

With either method, the output is similar to:

```
secret/db-user-pass created
```

### Verify the Secret

Check that the Secret was created:

```
kubectl get secrets
```

The output is similar to:

```
NAME              TYPE       DATA      AGE
db-user-pass      Opaque     2         51s
```

View the details of the Secret:

```
kubectl describe secret db-user-pass
```

The output is similar to:

```
Name:            db-user-pass
Namespace:       default
Labels:          <none>
Annotations:     <none>

Type:            Opaque

Data
====
password:    12 bytes
username:    5 bytes
```

The commands `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` avoid showing the contents
of a `Secret` by default. This is to protect the `Secret` from being exposed
accidentally, or from being stored in a terminal log.

### Decode the Secret

1. View the contents of the Secret you created:

   ```
   kubectl get secret db-user-pass -o jsonpath='{.data}'
   ```

   The output is similar to:

   ```
   { "password": "UyFCXCpkJHpEc2I9", "username": "YWRtaW4=" }
   ```
2. Decode the `password` data:

   ```
   echo 'UyFCXCpkJHpEc2I9' | base64 --decode
   ```

   The output is similar to:

   ```
   S!B\*d$zDsb=
   ```

   > **Caution:**
   > This is an example for documentation purposes. In practice,
   > this method could cause the command with the encoded data to be stored in
   > your shell history. Anyone with access to your computer could find the
   > command and decode the secret. A better approach is to combine the view and
   > decode commands.

   ```
   kubectl get secret db-user-pass -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode
   ```

## Edit a Secret

You can edit an existing `Secret` object unless it is
[immutable](/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-immutable). To edit a
Secret, run the following command:

```
kubectl edit secrets <secret-name>
```

This opens your default editor and allows you to update the base64 encoded
Secret values in the `data` field, such as in the following example:

```
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file, it will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.
#
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: UyFCXCpkJHpEc2I9
  username: YWRtaW4=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-06-28T17:44:13Z"
  name: db-user-pass
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "12708504"
  uid: 91becd59-78fa-4c85-823f-6d44436242ac
type: Opaque
```

## Clean up

To delete a Secret, run the following command:

```
kubectl delete secret db-user-pass
```
