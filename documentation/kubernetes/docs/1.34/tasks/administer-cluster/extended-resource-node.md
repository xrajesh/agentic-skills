# Advertise Extended Resources for a Node

This page shows how to specify extended resources for a Node.
Extended resources allow cluster administrators to advertise node-level
resources that would otherwise be unknown to Kubernetes.

## Before you begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds?category=kubernetes&filter=all)
* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/public-playgrounds)
* [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

To check the version, enter `kubectl version`.

## Get the names of your Nodes

```
kubectl get nodes
```

Choose one of your Nodes to use for this exercise.

## Advertise a new extended resource on one of your Nodes

To advertise a new extended resource on a Node, send an HTTP PATCH request to
the Kubernetes API server. For example, suppose one of your Nodes has four dongles
attached. Here's an example of a PATCH request that advertises four dongle resources
for your Node.

```
PATCH /api/v1/nodes/<your-node-name>/status HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json-patch+json
Host: k8s-master:8080

[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/status/capacity/example.com~1dongle",
    "value": "4"
  }
]
```

Note that Kubernetes does not need to know what a dongle is or what a dongle is for.
The preceding PATCH request tells Kubernetes that your Node has four things that
you call dongles.

Start a proxy, so that you can easily send requests to the Kubernetes API server:

```
kubectl proxy
```

In another command window, send the HTTP PATCH request.
Replace `<your-node-name>` with the name of your Node:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '[{"op": "add", "path": "/status/capacity/example.com~1dongle", "value": "4"}]' \
  http://localhost:8001/api/v1/nodes/<your-node-name>/status
```

> **Note:**
> In the preceding request, `~1` is the encoding for the character / in
> the patch path. The operation path value in JSON-Patch is interpreted as a
> JSON-Pointer. For more details, see
> [IETF RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901), section 3.

The output shows that the Node has a capacity of 4 dongles:

```
"capacity": {
  "cpu": "2",
  "memory": "2049008Ki",
  "example.com/dongle": "4",
```

Describe your Node:

```
kubectl describe node <your-node-name>
```

Once again, the output shows the dongle resource:

```
Capacity:
  cpu: 2
  memory: 2049008Ki
  example.com/dongle: 4
```

Now, application developers can create Pods that request a certain
number of dongles. See
[Assign Extended Resources to a Container](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/extended-resource/).

## Discussion

Extended resources are similar to memory and CPU resources. For example,
just as a Node has a certain amount of memory and CPU to be shared by all components
running on the Node, it can have a certain number of dongles to be shared
by all components running on the Node. And just as application developers
can create Pods that request a certain amount of memory and CPU, they can
create Pods that request a certain number of dongles.

Extended resources are opaque to Kubernetes; Kubernetes does not
know anything about what they are. Kubernetes knows only that a Node
has a certain number of them. Extended resources must be advertised in integer
amounts. For example, a Node can advertise four dongles, but not 4.5 dongles.

### Storage example

Suppose a Node has 800 GiB of a special kind of disk storage. You could
create a name for the special storage, say example.com/special-storage.
Then you could advertise it in chunks of a certain size, say 100 GiB. In that case,
your Node would advertise that it has eight resources of type
example.com/special-storage.

```
Capacity:
 ...
 example.com/special-storage: 8
```

If you want to allow arbitrary requests for special storage, you
could advertise special storage in chunks of size 1 byte. In that case, you would advertise
800Gi resources of type example.com/special-storage.

```
Capacity:
 ...
 example.com/special-storage:  800Gi
```

Then a Container could request any number of bytes of special storage, up to 800Gi.

## Clean up

Here is a PATCH request that removes the dongle advertisement from a Node.

```
PATCH /api/v1/nodes/<your-node-name>/status HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json-patch+json
Host: k8s-master:8080

[
  {
    "op": "remove",
    "path": "/status/capacity/example.com~1dongle",
  }
]
```

Start a proxy, so that you can easily send requests to the Kubernetes API server:

```
kubectl proxy
```

In another command window, send the HTTP PATCH request.
Replace `<your-node-name>` with the name of your Node:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/status/capacity/example.com~1dongle"}]' \
  http://localhost:8001/api/v1/nodes/<your-node-name>/status
```

Verify that the dongle advertisement has been removed:

```
kubectl describe node <your-node-name> | grep dongle
```

(you should not see any output)
