# Labels and Selectors

*Labels* are key/value pairs that are attached to
[objects](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/#kubernetes-objects "An entity in the Kubernetes system, representing part of the state of your cluster.") such as Pods.
Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects
that are meaningful and relevant to users, but do not directly imply semantics
to the core system. Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of
objects. Labels can be attached to objects at creation time and subsequently
added and modified at any time. Each object can have a set of key/value labels
defined. Each Key must be unique for a given object.

```
"metadata": {
  "labels": {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2"
  }
}
```

Labels allow for efficient queries and watches and are ideal for use in UIs
and CLIs. Non-identifying information should be recorded using
[annotations](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/).

## Motivation

Labels enable users to map their own organizational structures onto system objects
in a loosely coupled fashion, without requiring clients to store these mappings.

Service deployments and batch processing pipelines are often multi-dimensional entities
(e.g., multiple partitions or deployments, multiple release tracks, multiple tiers,
multiple micro-services per tier). Management often requires cross-cutting operations,
which breaks encapsulation of strictly hierarchical representations, especially rigid
hierarchies determined by the infrastructure rather than by users.

Example labels:

* `"release" : "stable"`, `"release" : "canary"`
* `"environment" : "dev"`, `"environment" : "qa"`, `"environment" : "production"`
* `"tier" : "frontend"`, `"tier" : "backend"`, `"tier" : "cache"`
* `"partition" : "customerA"`, `"partition" : "customerB"`
* `"track" : "daily"`, `"track" : "weekly"`

These are examples of
[commonly used labels](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/);
you are free to develop your own conventions.
Keep in mind that label Key must be unique for a given object.

## Syntax and character set

*Labels* are key/value pairs. Valid label keys have two segments: an optional
prefix and name, separated by a slash (`/`). The name segment is required and
must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric
character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`),
and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix
must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`),
not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).

If the prefix is omitted, the label Key is presumed to be private to the user.
Automated system components (e.g. `kube-scheduler`, `kube-controller-manager`,
`kube-apiserver`, `kubectl`, or other third-party automation) which add labels
to end-user objects must specify a prefix.

The `kubernetes.io/` and `k8s.io/` prefixes are
[reserved](/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/) for Kubernetes core components.

Valid label value:

* must be 63 characters or less (can be empty),
* unless empty, must begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`),
* could contain dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.

For example, here's a manifest for a Pod that has two labels
`environment: production` and `app: nginx`:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: label-demo
  labels:
    environment: production
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

## Label selectors

Unlike [names and UIDs](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/), labels
do not provide uniqueness. In general, we expect many objects to carry the same label(s).

Via a *label selector*, the client/user can identify a set of objects.
The label selector is the core grouping primitive in Kubernetes.

The API currently supports two types of selectors: *equality-based* and *set-based*.
A label selector can be made of multiple *requirements* which are comma-separated.
In the case of multiple requirements, all must be satisfied so the comma separator
acts as a logical *AND* (`&&`) operator.

The semantics of empty or non-specified selectors are dependent on the context,
and API types that use selectors should document the validity and meaning of
them.

> **Note:**
> For some API types, such as ReplicaSets, the label selectors of two instances must
> not overlap within a namespace, or the controller can see that as conflicting
> instructions and fail to determine how many replicas should be present.

> **Caution:**
> For both equality-based and set-based conditions there is no logical *OR* (`||`) operator.
> Ensure your filter statements are structured accordingly.

### *Equality-based* requirement

*Equality-* or *inequality-based* requirements allow filtering by label keys and values.
Matching objects must satisfy all of the specified label constraints, though they may
have additional labels as well. Three kinds of operators are admitted `=`,`==`,`!=`.
The first two represent *equality* (and are synonyms), while the latter represents *inequality*.
For example:

```
environment = production
tier != frontend
```

The former selects all resources with key equal to `environment` and value equal to `production`.
The latter selects all resources with key equal to `tier` and value distinct from `frontend`,
and all resources with no labels with the `tier` key. One could filter for resources in `production`
excluding `frontend` using the comma operator: `environment=production,tier!=frontend`

One usage scenario for equality-based label requirement is for Pods to specify
node selection criteria. For example, the sample Pod below selects nodes where
the `accelerator` label exists and is set to `nvidia-tesla-p100`.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: cuda-test
spec:
  containers:
    - name: cuda-test
      image: "registry.k8s.io/cuda-vector-add:v0.1"
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 1
  nodeSelector:
    accelerator: nvidia-tesla-p100
```

### *Set-based* requirement

*Set-based* label requirements allow filtering keys according to a set of values.
Three kinds of operators are supported: `in`,`notin` and `exists` (only the key identifier).
For example:

```
environment in (production, qa)
tier notin (frontend, backend)
partition
!partition
```

* The first example selects all resources with key equal to `environment` and value
  equal to `production` or `qa`.
* The second example selects all resources with key equal to `tier` and values other
  than `frontend` and `backend`, and all resources with no labels with the `tier` key.
* The third example selects all resources including a label with key `partition`;
  no values are checked.
* The fourth example selects all resources without a label with key `partition`;
  no values are checked.

Similarly the comma separator acts as an *AND* operator. So filtering resources
with a `partition` key (no matter the value) and with `environment` different
than `qa` can be achieved using `partition,environment notin (qa)`.
The *set-based* label selector is a general form of equality since
`environment=production` is equivalent to `environment in (production)`;
similarly for `!=` and `notin`.

*Set-based* requirements can be mixed with *equality-based* requirements.
For example: `partition in (customerA, customerB),environment!=qa`.

## API

### LIST and WATCH filtering

For **list** and **watch** operations, you can specify label selectors to filter the sets of objects
returned; you specify the filter using a query parameter.
(To learn in detail about watches in Kubernetes, read
[efficient detection of changes](/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#efficient-detection-of-changes)).
Both requirements are permitted
(presented here as they would appear in a URL query string):

* *equality-based* requirements: `?labelSelector=environment%3Dproduction,tier%3Dfrontend`
* *set-based* requirements: `?labelSelector=environment+in+%28production%2Cqa%29%2Ctier+in+%28frontend%29`

Both label selector styles can be used to list or watch resources via a REST client.
For example, targeting `apiserver` with `kubectl` and using *equality-based* one may write:

```
kubectl get pods -l environment=production,tier=frontend
```

or using *set-based* requirements:

```
kubectl get pods -l 'environment in (production),tier in (frontend)'
```

As already mentioned *set-based* requirements are more expressive.
For instance, they can implement the *OR* operator on values:

```
kubectl get pods -l 'environment in (production, qa)'
```

or restricting negative matching via *notin* operator:

```
kubectl get pods -l 'environment,environment notin (frontend)'
```

### Set references in API objects

Some Kubernetes objects, such as [`services`](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
and [`replicationcontrollers`](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/),
also use label selectors to specify sets of other resources, such as
[pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).

#### Service and ReplicationController

The set of pods that a `service` targets is defined with a label selector.
Similarly, the population of pods that a `replicationcontroller` should
manage is also defined with a label selector.

Label selectors for both objects are defined in `json` or `yaml` files using maps,
and only *equality-based* requirement selectors are supported:

```
"selector": {
    "component" : "redis",
}
```

or

```
selector:
  component: redis
```

This selector (respectively in `json` or `yaml` format) is equivalent to
`component=redis` or `component in (redis)`.

#### Resources that support set-based requirements

Newer resources, such as [`Job`](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/),
[`Deployment`](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/),
[`ReplicaSet`](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/), and
[`DaemonSet`](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/),
support *set-based* requirements as well.

```
selector:
  matchLabels:
    component: redis
  matchExpressions:
    - { key: tier, operator: In, values: [cache] }
    - { key: environment, operator: NotIn, values: [dev] }
```

`matchLabels` is a map of `{key,value}` pairs. A single `{key,value}` in the
`matchLabels` map is equivalent to an element of `matchExpressions`, whose `key`
field is "key", the `operator` is "In", and the `values` array contains only "value".
`matchExpressions` is a list of pod selector requirements. Valid operators include
In, NotIn, Exists, and DoesNotExist. The values set must be non-empty in the case of
In and NotIn. All of the requirements, from both `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`
are ANDed together -- they must all be satisfied in order to match.

#### Selecting sets of nodes

One use case for selecting over labels is to constrain the set of nodes onto which
a pod can schedule. See the documentation on
[node selection](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/) for more information.

## Using labels effectively

You can apply a single label to any resources, but this is not always the
best practice. There are many scenarios where multiple labels should be used to
distinguish resource sets from one another.

For instance, different applications would use different values for the `app` label, but a
multi-tier application, such as the [guestbook example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/web/guestbook/),
would additionally need to distinguish each tier. The frontend could carry the following labels:

```
labels:
  app: guestbook
  tier: frontend
```

while the Redis master and replica would have different `tier` labels, and perhaps even an
additional `role` label:

```
labels:
  app: guestbook
  tier: backend
  role: master
```

and

```
labels:
  app: guestbook
  tier: backend
  role: replica
```

The labels allow for slicing and dicing the resources along any dimension specified by a label:

```
kubectl apply -f examples/guestbook/all-in-one/guestbook-all-in-one.yaml
kubectl get pods -Lapp -Ltier -Lrole
```

```
NAME                           READY  STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   APP         TIER       ROLE
guestbook-fe-4nlpb             1/1    Running   0          1m    guestbook   frontend   <none>
guestbook-fe-ght6d             1/1    Running   0          1m    guestbook   frontend   <none>
guestbook-fe-jpy62             1/1    Running   0          1m    guestbook   frontend   <none>
guestbook-redis-master-5pg3b   1/1    Running   0          1m    guestbook   backend    master
guestbook-redis-replica-2q2yf  1/1    Running   0          1m    guestbook   backend    replica
guestbook-redis-replica-qgazl  1/1    Running   0          1m    guestbook   backend    replica
my-nginx-divi2                 1/1    Running   0          29m   nginx       <none>     <none>
my-nginx-o0ef1                 1/1    Running   0          29m   nginx       <none>     <none>
```

```
kubectl get pods -lapp=guestbook,role=replica
```

```
NAME                           READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE
guestbook-redis-replica-2q2yf  1/1    Running  0         3m
guestbook-redis-replica-qgazl  1/1    Running  0         3m
```

## Updating labels

Sometimes you may want to relabel existing pods and other resources before creating
new resources. This can be done with `kubectl label`.
For example, if you want to label all your NGINX Pods as frontend tier, run:

```
kubectl label pods -l app=nginx tier=fe
```

```
pod/my-nginx-2035384211-j5fhi labeled
pod/my-nginx-2035384211-u2c7e labeled
pod/my-nginx-2035384211-u3t6x labeled
```

This first filters all pods with the label "app=nginx", and then labels them with the "tier=fe".
To see the pods you labeled, run:

```
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx -L tier
```

```
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       TIER
my-nginx-2035384211-j5fhi   1/1       Running   0          23m       fe
my-nginx-2035384211-u2c7e   1/1       Running   0          23m       fe
my-nginx-2035384211-u3t6x   1/1       Running   0          23m       fe
```

This outputs all "app=nginx" pods, with an additional label column of pods' tier
(specified with `-L` or `--label-columns`).

For more information, please see [kubectl label](/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands/#label).
