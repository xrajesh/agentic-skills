# Finalizers

Finalizers are namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific
conditions are met before it fully deletes [resources](/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#standard-api-terminology "A Kubernetes entity, representing an endpoint on the Kubernetes API server.")
that are marked for deletion.
Finalizers alert [controllers](/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/ "A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state.")
to clean up resources the deleted object owned.

When you tell Kubernetes to delete an object that has finalizers specified for
it, the Kubernetes API marks the object for deletion by populating `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`,
and returns a `202` status code (HTTP "Accepted"). The target object remains in a terminating state while the
control plane, or other components, take the actions defined by the finalizers.
After these actions are complete, the controller removes the relevant finalizers
from the target object. When the `metadata.finalizers` field is empty,
Kubernetes considers the deletion complete and deletes the object.

You can use finalizers to control [garbage collection](/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/ "A collective term for the various mechanisms Kubernetes uses to clean up cluster resources.")
of resources. For example, you can define a finalizer to clean up related
[API resources](/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#standard-api-terminology "A Kubernetes entity, representing an endpoint on the Kubernetes API server.") or infrastructure before the controller
deletes the object being finalized.

You can use finalizers to control [garbage collection](/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/ "A collective term for the various mechanisms Kubernetes uses to clean up cluster resources.")
of [objects](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/#kubernetes-objects "An entity in the Kubernetes system, representing part of the state of your cluster.") by alerting [controllers](/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/ "A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state.")
to perform specific cleanup tasks before deleting the target resource.

Finalizers don't usually specify the code to execute. Instead, they are
typically lists of keys on a specific resource similar to annotations.
Kubernetes specifies some finalizers automatically, but you can also specify
your own.

## How finalizers work

When you create a resource using a manifest file, you can specify finalizers in
the `metadata.finalizers` field. When you attempt to delete the resource, the
API server handling the delete request notices the values in the `finalizers` field
and does the following:

* Modifies the object to add a `metadata.deletionTimestamp` field with the
  time you started the deletion.
* Prevents the object from being removed until all items are removed from its `metadata.finalizers` field
* Returns a `202` status code (HTTP "Accepted")

The controller managing that finalizer notices the update to the object setting the
`metadata.deletionTimestamp`, indicating deletion of the object has been requested.
The controller then attempts to satisfy the requirements of the finalizers
specified for that resource. Each time a finalizer condition is satisfied, the
controller removes that key from the resource's `finalizers` field. When the
`finalizers` field is emptied, an object with a `deletionTimestamp` field set
is automatically deleted. You can also use finalizers to prevent deletion of unmanaged resources.

A common example of a finalizer is `kubernetes.io/pv-protection`, which prevents
accidental deletion of `PersistentVolume` objects. When a `PersistentVolume`
object is in use by a Pod, Kubernetes adds the `pv-protection` finalizer. If you
try to delete the `PersistentVolume`, it enters a `Terminating` status, but the
controller can't delete it because the finalizer exists. When the Pod stops
using the `PersistentVolume`, Kubernetes clears the `pv-protection` finalizer,
and the controller deletes the volume.

> **Note:**
> * When you `DELETE` an object, Kubernetes adds the deletion timestamp for that object and then
> immediately starts to restrict changes to the `.metadata.finalizers` field for the object that is
> now pending deletion. You can remove existing finalizers (deleting an entry from the `finalizers`
> list) but you cannot add a new finalizer. You also cannot modify the `deletionTimestamp` for an
> object once it is set.
> * After the deletion is requested, you can not resurrect this object. The only way is to delete it and make a new similar object.

> **Note:**
> Custom finalizer names **must** be publicly qualified finalizer names, such as `example.com/finalizer-name`.
> Kubernetes enforces this format; the API server rejects writes to objects where the change does not use qualified finalizer names for any custom finalizer.

## Owner references, labels, and finalizers

Like [labels](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels "Tags objects with identifying attributes that are meaningful and relevant to users."),
[owner references](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/owners-dependents/)
describe the relationships between objects in Kubernetes, but are used for a
different purpose. When a
[controller](/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/ "A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state.") manages objects
like Pods, it uses labels to track changes to groups of related objects. For
example, when a [Job](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/ "A finite or batch task that runs to completion.") creates one or
more Pods, the Job controller applies labels to those pods and tracks changes to
any Pods in the cluster with the same label.

The Job controller also adds *owner references* to those Pods, pointing at the
Job that created the Pods. If you delete the Job while these Pods are running,
Kubernetes uses the owner references (not labels) to determine which Pods in the
cluster need cleanup.

Kubernetes also processes finalizers when it identifies owner references on a
resource targeted for deletion.

In some situations, finalizers can block the deletion of dependent objects,
which can cause the targeted owner object to remain for
longer than expected without being fully deleted. In these situations, you
should check finalizers and owner references on the target owner and dependent
objects to troubleshoot the cause.

> **Note:**
> In cases where objects are stuck in a deleting state, avoid manually
> removing finalizers to allow deletion to continue. Finalizers are usually added
> to resources for a reason, so forcefully removing them can lead to issues in
> your cluster. This should only be done when the purpose of the finalizer is
> understood and is accomplished in another way (for example, manually cleaning
> up some dependent object).
