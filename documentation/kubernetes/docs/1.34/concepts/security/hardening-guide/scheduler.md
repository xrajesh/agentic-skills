# Hardening Guide - Scheduler Configuration

Information about how to make the Kubernetes scheduler more secure.

The Kubernetes [scheduler](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/ "Control plane component that watches for newly created pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.") is
one of the critical components of the
[control plane](/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane "The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers.").

This document covers how to improve the security posture of the Scheduler.

A misconfigured scheduler can have security implications.
Such a scheduler can target specific nodes and evict the workloads or applications that are sharing the node and its resources.
This can aid an attacker with a [Yo-Yo attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00542): an attack on a vulnerable autoscaler.

## kube-scheduler configuration

### Scheduler authentication & authorization command line options

When setting up authentication configuration, it should be made sure that kube-scheduler's authentication remains consistent with kube-api-server's authentication.
If any request has missing authentication headers,
the [authentication should happen through the kube-api-server allowing all authentication to be consistent in the cluster](/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-aggregation-layer/#original-request-username-and-group).

* `authentication-kubeconfig`: Make sure to provide a proper kubeconfig so that the scheduler can retrieve authentication configuration options from the API Server. This kubeconfig file should be protected with strict file permissions.
* `authentication-tolerate-lookup-failure`: Set this to `false` to make sure the scheduler *always* looks up its authentication configuration from the API server.
* `authentication-skip-lookup`: Set this to `false` to make sure the scheduler *always* looks up its authentication configuration from the API server.
* `authorization-always-allow-paths`: These paths should respond with data that is appropriate for anonymous authorization. Defaults to `/healthz,/readyz,/livez`.
* `profiling`: Set to `false` to disable the profiling endpoints which are provide debugging information but which should not be enabled on production clusters as they present a risk of denial of service or information leakage. The `--profiling` argument is deprecated and can now be provided through the [KubeScheduler DebuggingConfiguration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kube-scheduler-config.v1/#DebuggingConfiguration). Profiling can be disabled through the kube-scheduler config by setting `enableProfiling` to `false`.
* `requestheader-client-ca-file`: Avoid passing this argument.

### Scheduler networking command line options

* `bind-address`: In most cases, the kube-scheduler does not need to be externally accessible. Setting the bind address to `localhost` is a secure practice.
* `permit-address-sharing`: Set this to `false` to disable connection sharing through `SO_REUSEADDR`. `SO_REUSEADDR` can lead to reuse of terminated connections that are in `TIME_WAIT` state.
* `permit-port-sharing`: Default `false`. Use the default unless you are confident you understand the security implications.

### Scheduler TLS command line options

* `tls-cipher-suites`: Always provide a list of preferred cipher suites. This ensures encryption never happens with insecure cipher suites.

## Scheduling configurations for custom schedulers

When using custom schedulers based on the Kubernetes scheduling code, cluster administrators need to be careful with
plugins that use the `queueSort`, `prefilter`, `filter`, or `permit` [extension points](/docs/reference/scheduling/config/#extension-points).
These extension points control various stages of a scheduling process, and the wrong configuration can impact the kube-scheduler's behavior in your cluster.

### Key considerations

* Exactly one plugin that uses the `queueSort` extension point can be enabled at a time. Any plugins that use `queueSort` should be scrutinized.
* Plugins that implement the `prefilter` or `filter` extension point can potentially mark all nodes as unschedulable. This can bring scheduling of new pods to a halt.
* Plugins that implement the `permit` extension point can prevent or delay the binding of a Pod. Such plugins should be thoroughly reviewed by the cluster administrator.

When using a plugin that is not one of the [default plugins](/docs/reference/scheduling/config/#scheduling-plugins), consider disabling the `queueSort`, `filter` and `permit` extension points as follows:

```
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
  - schedulerName: my-scheduler
    plugins:
      # Disable specific plugins for different extension points
      # You can disable all plugins for an extension point using "*"
      queueSort:
        disabled:
        - name: "*"             # Disable all queueSort plugins
      # - name: "PrioritySort"  # Disable specific queueSort plugin
      filter:
        disabled:
        - name: "*"                 # Disable all filter plugins
      # - name: "NodeResourcesFit"  # Disable specific filter plugin
      permit:
        disabled:
        - name: "*"               # Disables all permit plugins
      # - name: "TaintToleration" # Disable specific permit plugin
```

This creates a scheduler profile  `my-scheduler`.
Whenever the `.spec` of a Pod does not have a value for `.spec.schedulerName`, the kube-scheduler runs for that Pod,
using its main configuration, and default plugins.
If you define a Pod with `.spec.schedulerName` set to `my-scheduler`, the kube-scheduler runs but with a custom configuration; in that custom configuration,
the `queueSort`, `filter` and `permit` extension points are disabled.
If you use this KubeSchedulerConfiguration, and don't run any custom scheduler,
and you then define a Pod with `.spec.schedulerName` set to `nonexistent-scheduler`
(or any other scheduler name that doesn't exist in your cluster), no events would be generated for a pod.

## Disallow labeling nodes

A cluster administrator should ensure that cluster users cannot label the nodes.
A malicious actor can use `nodeSelector` to schedule workloads on nodes where those workloads should not be present.
