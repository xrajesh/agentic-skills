# Logging Architecture

Application logs can help you understand what is happening inside your application. The
logs are particularly useful for debugging problems and monitoring cluster activity. Most
modern applications have some kind of logging mechanism. Likewise, container engines
are designed to support logging. The easiest and most adopted logging method for
containerized applications is writing to standard output and standard error streams.

However, the native functionality provided by a container engine or runtime is usually
not enough for a complete logging solution.

For example, you may want to access your application's logs if a container crashes,
a pod gets evicted, or a node dies.

In a cluster, logs should have a separate storage and lifecycle independent of nodes,
pods, or containers. This concept is called
[cluster-level logging](#cluster-level-logging-architectures).

Cluster-level logging architectures require a separate backend to store, analyze, and
query logs. Kubernetes does not provide a native storage solution for log data. Instead,
there are many logging solutions that integrate with Kubernetes. The following sections
describe how to handle and store logs on nodes.

## Pod and container logs

Kubernetes captures logs from each container in a running Pod.

This example uses a manifest for a `Pod` with a container
that writes text to the standard output stream, once per second.

[`debug/counter-pod.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/debug/counter-pod.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy debug/counter-pod.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: counter
spec:
  containers:
  - name: count
    image: busybox:1.28
    args: [/bin/sh, -c,
            'i=0; while true; do echo "$i: $(date)"; i=$((i+1)); sleep 1; done']
```

To run this pod, use the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/debug/counter-pod.yaml
```

The output is:

```
pod/counter created
```

To fetch the logs, use the `kubectl logs` command, as follows:

```
kubectl logs counter
```

The output is similar to:

```
0: Fri Apr  1 11:42:23 UTC 2022
1: Fri Apr  1 11:42:24 UTC 2022
2: Fri Apr  1 11:42:25 UTC 2022
```

You can use `kubectl logs --previous` to retrieve logs from a previous instantiation of a container.
If your pod has multiple containers, specify which container's logs you want to access by
appending a container name to the command, with a `-c` flag, like so:

```
kubectl logs counter -c count
```

### Container log streams

FEATURE STATE:
`Kubernetes v1.32 [alpha]`(disabled by default)

As an alpha feature, the kubelet can split out the logs from the two standard streams produced
by a container: [standard output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout))
and [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)).
To use this behavior, you must enable the `PodLogsQuerySplitStreams`
[feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/).
With that feature gate enabled, Kubernetes 1.34 allows access to these
log streams directly via the Pod API. You can fetch a specific stream by specifying the stream name (either `Stdout` or `Stderr`),
using the `stream` query string. You must have access to read the `log` subresource of that Pod.

To demonstrate this feature, you can create a Pod that periodically writes text to both the standard output and error stream.

[`debug/counter-pod-err.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/debug/counter-pod-err.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy debug/counter-pod-err.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: counter-err
spec:
  containers:
  - name: count
    image: busybox:1.28
    args: [/bin/sh, -c,
            'i=0; while true; do echo "$i: $(date)"; echo "$i: err" >&2 ; i=$((i+1)); sleep 1; done']
```

To run this pod, use the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/debug/counter-pod-err.yaml
```

To fetch only the stderr log stream, you can run:

```
kubectl get --raw "/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/counter-err/log?stream=Stderr"
```

See the [`kubectl logs` documentation](/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#logs)
for more details.

### How nodes handle container logs

![Node level logging](/images/docs/user-guide/logging/logging-node-level.png)

A container runtime handles and redirects any output generated to a containerized
application's `stdout` and `stderr` streams.
Different container runtimes implement this in different ways; however, the integration
with the kubelet is standardized as the *CRI logging format*.

By default, if a container restarts, the kubelet keeps one terminated container with its logs.
If a pod is evicted from the node, all corresponding containers are also evicted, along with their logs.

The kubelet makes logs available to clients via a special feature of the Kubernetes API.
The usual way to access this is by running `kubectl logs`.

### Log rotation

FEATURE STATE:
`Kubernetes v1.21 [stable]`

The kubelet is responsible for rotating container logs and managing the
logging directory structure.
The kubelet sends this information to the container runtime (using CRI),
and the runtime writes the container logs to the given location.

You can configure two kubelet [configuration settings](/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/),
`containerLogMaxSize` (default 10Mi) and `containerLogMaxFiles` (default 5),
using the [kubelet configuration file](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/).
These settings let you configure the maximum size for each log file and the maximum number of
files allowed for each container respectively.

In order to perform an efficient log rotation in clusters where the volume of the logs generated by
the workload is large, kubelet also provides a mechanism to tune how the logs are rotated in
terms of how many concurrent log rotations can be performed and the interval at which the logs are
monitored and rotated as required.
You can configure two kubelet [configuration settings](/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/),
`containerLogMaxWorkers` and `containerLogMonitorInterval` using the
[kubelet configuration file](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/).

When you run [`kubectl logs`](/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#logs) as in
the basic logging example, the kubelet on the node handles the request and
reads directly from the log file. The kubelet returns the content of the log file.

> **Note:**
> Only the contents of the latest log file are available through `kubectl logs`.
>
> For example, if a Pod writes 40 MiB of logs and the kubelet rotates logs
> after 10 MiB, running `kubectl logs` returns at most 10MiB of data.

## System component logs

There are two types of system components: those that typically run in a container,
and those components directly involved in running containers. For example:

* The kubelet and container runtime do not run in containers. The kubelet runs
  your containers (grouped together in [pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ "A Pod represents a set of running containers in your cluster."))
* The Kubernetes scheduler, controller manager, and API server run within pods
  (usually [static Pods](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/static-pod/ "A pod managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node.")).
  The etcd component runs in the control plane, and most commonly also as a static pod.
  If your cluster uses kube-proxy, you typically run this as a `DaemonSet`.

### Log locations

The way that the kubelet and container runtime write logs depends on the operating
system that the node uses:

* Linux
  * Windows

On Linux nodes that use systemd, the kubelet and container runtime write to journald
by default. You use `journalctl` to read the systemd journal; for example:
`journalctl -u kubelet`.

If systemd is not present, the kubelet and container runtime write to `.log` files in the
`/var/log` directory. If you want to have logs written elsewhere, you can indirectly
run the kubelet via a helper tool, `kube-log-runner`, and use that tool to redirect
kubelet logs to a directory that you choose.

By default, kubelet directs your container runtime to write logs into directories within
`/var/log/pods`.

For more information on `kube-log-runner`, read [System Logs](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/#klog).

By default, the kubelet writes logs to files within the directory `C:\var\logs`
(notice that this is not `C:\var\log`).

Although `C:\var\log` is the Kubernetes default location for these logs, several
cluster deployment tools set up Windows nodes to log to `C:\var\log\kubelet` instead.

If you want to have logs written elsewhere, you can indirectly
run the kubelet via a helper tool, `kube-log-runner`, and use that tool to redirect
kubelet logs to a directory that you choose.

However, by default, kubelet directs your container runtime to write logs within the
directory `C:\var\log\pods`.

For more information on `kube-log-runner`, read [System Logs](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/#klog).

For Kubernetes cluster components that run in pods, these write to files inside
the `/var/log` directory, bypassing the default logging mechanism (the components
do not write to the systemd journal). You can use Kubernetes' storage mechanisms
to map persistent storage into the container that runs the component.

Kubelet allows changing the pod logs directory from default `/var/log/pods`
to a custom path. This adjustment can be made by configuring the `podLogsDir`
parameter in the kubelet's configuration file.

> **Caution:**
> It's important to note that the default location `/var/log/pods` has been in use for
> an extended period and certain processes might implicitly assume this path.
> Therefore, altering this parameter must be approached with caution and at your own risk.
>
> Another caveat to keep in mind is that the kubelet supports the location being on the same
> disk as `/var`. Otherwise, if the logs are on a separate filesystem from `/var`,
> then the kubelet will not track that filesystem's usage, potentially leading to issues if
> it fills up.

For details about etcd and its logs, view the [etcd documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/).
Again, you can use Kubernetes' storage mechanisms to map persistent storage into
the container that runs the component.

> **Note:**
> If you deploy Kubernetes cluster components (such as the scheduler) to log to
> a volume shared from the parent node, you need to consider and ensure that those
> logs are rotated. **Kubernetes does not manage that log rotation**.
>
> Your operating system may automatically implement some log rotation - for example,
> if you share the directory `/var/log` into a static Pod for a component, node-level
> log rotation treats a file in that directory the same as a file written by any component
> outside Kubernetes.
>
> Some deploy tools account for that log rotation and automate it; others leave this
> as your responsibility.

## Cluster-level logging architectures

While Kubernetes does not provide a native solution for cluster-level logging, there are
several common approaches you can consider. Here are some options:

* Use a node-level logging agent that runs on every node.
* Include a dedicated sidecar container for logging in an application pod.
* Push logs directly to a backend from within an application.

### Using a node logging agent

![Using a node level logging agent](/images/docs/user-guide/logging/logging-with-node-agent.png)

You can implement cluster-level logging by including a *node-level logging agent* on each node.
The logging agent is a dedicated tool that exposes logs or pushes logs to a backend.
Commonly, the logging agent is a container that has access to a directory with log files from all of the
application containers on that node.

Because the logging agent must run on every node, it is recommended to run the agent
as a `DaemonSet`.

Node-level logging creates only one agent per node and doesn't require any changes to the
applications running on the node.

Containers write to stdout and stderr, but with no agreed format. A node-level agent collects
these logs and forwards them for aggregation.

### Using a sidecar container with the logging agent

You can use a sidecar container in one of the following ways:

* The sidecar container streams application logs to its own `stdout`.
* The sidecar container runs a logging agent, which is configured to pick up logs
  from an application container.

#### Streaming sidecar container

![Sidecar container with a streaming container](/images/docs/user-guide/logging/logging-with-streaming-sidecar.png)

By having your sidecar containers write to their own `stdout` and `stderr`
streams, you can take advantage of the kubelet and the logging agent that
already run on each node. The sidecar containers read logs from a file, a socket,
or journald. Each sidecar container prints a log to its own `stdout` or `stderr` stream.

This approach allows you to separate several log streams from different
parts of your application, some of which can lack support
for writing to `stdout` or `stderr`. The logic behind redirecting logs
is minimal, so it's not a significant overhead. Additionally, because
`stdout` and `stderr` are handled by the kubelet, you can use built-in tools
like `kubectl logs`.

For example, a pod runs a single container, and the container
writes to two different log files using two different formats. Here's a
manifest for the Pod:

[`admin/logging/two-files-counter-pod.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/admin/logging/two-files-counter-pod.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy admin/logging/two-files-counter-pod.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: counter
spec:
  containers:
  - name: count
    image: busybox:1.28
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - >
      i=0;
      while true;
      do
        echo "$i: $(date)" >> /var/log/1.log;
        echo "$(date) INFO $i" >> /var/log/2.log;
        i=$((i+1));
        sleep 1;
      done
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  volumes:
  - name: varlog
    emptyDir: {}
```

It is not recommended to write log entries with different formats to the same log
stream, even if you managed to redirect both components to the `stdout` stream of
the container. Instead, you can create two sidecar containers. Each sidecar
container could tail a particular log file from a shared volume and then redirect
the logs to its own `stdout` stream.

Here's a manifest for a pod that has two sidecar containers:

[`admin/logging/two-files-counter-pod-streaming-sidecar.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/admin/logging/two-files-counter-pod-streaming-sidecar.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy admin/logging/two-files-counter-pod-streaming-sidecar.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: counter
spec:
  containers:
  - name: count
    image: busybox:1.28
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - >
      i=0;
      while true;
      do
        echo "$i: $(date)" >> /var/log/1.log;
        echo "$(date) INFO $i" >> /var/log/2.log;
        i=$((i+1));
        sleep 1;
      done
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  - name: count-log-1
    image: busybox:1.28
    args: [/bin/sh, -c, 'tail -n+1 -F /var/log/1.log']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  - name: count-log-2
    image: busybox:1.28
    args: [/bin/sh, -c, 'tail -n+1 -F /var/log/2.log']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  volumes:
  - name: varlog
    emptyDir: {}
```

Now when you run this pod, you can access each log stream separately by
running the following commands:

```
kubectl logs counter count-log-1
```

The output is similar to:

```
0: Fri Apr  1 11:42:26 UTC 2022
1: Fri Apr  1 11:42:27 UTC 2022
2: Fri Apr  1 11:42:28 UTC 2022
...
```

```
kubectl logs counter count-log-2
```

The output is similar to:

```
Fri Apr  1 11:42:29 UTC 2022 INFO 0
Fri Apr  1 11:42:30 UTC 2022 INFO 0
Fri Apr  1 11:42:31 UTC 2022 INFO 0
...
```

If you installed a node-level agent in your cluster, that agent picks up those log
streams automatically without any further configuration. If you like, you can configure
the agent to parse log lines depending on the source container.

Even for Pods that only have low CPU and memory usage (order of a couple of millicores
for cpu and order of several megabytes for memory), writing logs to a file and
then streaming them to `stdout` can double how much storage you need on the node.
If you have an application that writes to a single file, it's recommended to set
`/dev/stdout` as the destination rather than implement the streaming sidecar
container approach.

Sidecar containers can also be used to rotate log files that cannot be rotated by
the application itself. An example of this approach is a small container running
`logrotate` periodically.
However, it's more straightforward to use `stdout` and `stderr` directly, and
leave rotation and retention policies to the kubelet.

#### Sidecar container with a logging agent

![Sidecar container with a logging agent](/images/docs/user-guide/logging/logging-with-sidecar-agent.png)

If the node-level logging agent is not flexible enough for your situation, you
can create a sidecar container with a separate logging agent that you have
configured specifically to run with your application.

> **Note:**
> Using a logging agent in a sidecar container can lead
> to significant resource consumption. Moreover, you won't be able to access
> those logs using `kubectl logs` because they are not controlled
> by the kubelet.

Here are two example manifests that you can use to implement a sidecar container with a logging agent.
The first manifest contains a [`ConfigMap`](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/)
to configure fluentd.

[`admin/logging/fluentd-sidecar-config.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/admin/logging/fluentd-sidecar-config.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy admin/logging/fluentd-sidecar-config.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fluentd-config
data:
  fluentd.conf: |
    <source>
      type tail
      format none
      path /var/log/1.log
      pos_file /var/log/1.log.pos
      tag count.format1
    </source>

    <source>
      type tail
      format none
      path /var/log/2.log
      pos_file /var/log/2.log.pos
      tag count.format2
    </source>

    <match **>
      type google_cloud
    </match>
```

> **Note:**
> In the sample configurations, you can replace fluentd with any logging agent, reading
> from any source inside an application container.

The second manifest describes a pod that has a sidecar container running fluentd.
The pod mounts a volume where fluentd can pick up its configuration data.

[`admin/logging/two-files-counter-pod-agent-sidecar.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/release-1.34/content/en/examples/admin/logging/two-files-counter-pod-agent-sidecar.yaml)![](/images/copycode.svg "Copy admin/logging/two-files-counter-pod-agent-sidecar.yaml to clipboard")

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: counter
spec:
  containers:
  - name: count
    image: busybox:1.28
    args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - >
      i=0;
      while true;
      do
        echo "$i: $(date)" >> /var/log/1.log;
        echo "$(date) INFO $i" >> /var/log/2.log;
        i=$((i+1));
        sleep 1;
      done
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
  - name: count-agent
    image: registry.k8s.io/fluentd-gcp:1.30
    env:
    - name: FLUENTD_ARGS
      value: -c /etc/fluentd-config/fluentd.conf
    volumeMounts:
    - name: varlog
      mountPath: /var/log
    - name: config-volume
      mountPath: /etc/fluentd-config
  volumes:
  - name: varlog
    emptyDir: {}
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: fluentd-config
```
