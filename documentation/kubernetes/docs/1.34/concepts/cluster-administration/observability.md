# Observability

Understand how to gain end-to-end visibility of a Kubernetes cluster through the collection of metrics, logs, and traces.

In Kubernetes, observability is the process of collecting and analyzing metrics, logs, and traces—often referred to as the three pillars of observability—in order to obtain a better understanding of the internal state, performance, and health of the cluster.

Kubernetes control plane components, as well as many add-ons, generate and emit these signals. By aggregating and correlating them, you can gain a unified picture of the control plane, add-ons, and applications across the cluster.

Figure 1 outlines how cluster components emit the three primary signal types.

    S --> O[Operators and automation]
```

## Metrics

Kubernetes components emit metrics in [Prometheus format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/) from their `/metrics` endpoints, including:

* kube-controller-manager
* kube-proxy
* kube-apiserver
* kube-scheduler
* kubelet

The kubelet also exposes metrics at `/metrics/cadvisor`, `/metrics/resource`, and `/metrics/probes`, and add-ons such as [kube-state-metrics](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/kube-state-metrics/) enrich those control plane signals with Kubernetes object status.

A typical Kubernetes metrics pipeline periodically scrapes these endpoints and stores the samples in a time series database (for example with Prometheus).

See the [system metrics guide](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-metrics/) for details and configuration options.

Figure 2 outlines a common Kubernetes metrics pipeline.

```

For multi-cluster or multi-cloud visibility, distributed time series databases (for example Thanos or Cortex) can complement Prometheus.

See [Common observability tools - metrics tools](#metrics-tools) for metrics scrapers and time series databases.

## Logs

Logs provide a chronological record of events inside applications, Kubernetes system components, and security-related activities such as audit logging.

Container runtimes capture a containerized application’s output from standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) streams. While runtimes implement this differently, the integration with the kubelet is standardized through the *CRI logging format*, and the kubelet makes these logs available through `kubectl logs`.

![Node-level logging](/images/docs/user-guide/logging/logging-node-level.png)

*Figure 3a. Node-level logging architecture.*

System component logs capture events from the cluster and are often useful for debugging and troubleshooting. These components are classified in two different ways: those that run in a container and those that do not. For example, the `kube-scheduler` and `kube-proxy` usually run in containers, whereas the `kubelet` and the container runtime run directly on the host.

* On machines with `systemd`, the kubelet and container runtime write to journald. Otherwise, they write to `.log` files in the `/var/log` directory.
* System components that run inside containers always write to `.log` files in `/var/log`, bypassing the default container logging mechanism.

System component and container logs stored under `/var/log` require log rotation to prevent uncontrolled growth. Some cluster provisioning scripts install log rotation by default; verify your environment and adjust as needed. See the [system logs reference](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/) for details on locations, formats, and configuration options.

Most clusters run a node-level logging agent (for example, Fluent Bit or Fluentd) that tails these files and forwards entries to a central log store. The [logging architecture guidance](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/) explains how to design such pipelines, apply retention, and log flows to backends.

Figure 3 outlines a common log aggregation pipeline.

    B --> N
    C --> N
    N --> L[Central log store]
    L --> Q[Dashboards, alerting, SIEM]
```

## Traces

Traces capture how requests moves across Kubernetes components and applications, linking latency, timing and relationships between operations.By collecting traces, you can visualize end-to-end request flow, diagnose performance issues, and identify bottlenecks or unexpected interactions in the control plane, add-ons, or applications.

Kubernetes 1.34 can export spans over the [OpenTelemetry Protocol](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-traces/) (OTLP), either directly via built-in gRPC exporters or by forwarding them through an OpenTelemetry Collector.

The OpenTelemetry Collector receives spans from components and applications, processes them (for example by applying sampling or redaction), and forwards them to a tracing backend for storage and analysis.

Figure 4 outlines a typical distributed tracing pipeline.
