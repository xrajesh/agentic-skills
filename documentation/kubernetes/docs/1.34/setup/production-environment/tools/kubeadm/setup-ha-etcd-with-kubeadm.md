# Set up a High Availability etcd Cluster with kubeadm

By default, kubeadm runs a local etcd instance on each control plane node.
It is also possible to treat the etcd cluster as external and provision
etcd instances on separate hosts. The differences between the two approaches are covered in the
[Options for Highly Available topology](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/ha-topology/) page.

This task walks through the process of creating a high availability external
etcd cluster of three members that can be used by kubeadm during cluster creation.

## Before you begin

* Three hosts that can talk to each other over TCP ports 2379 and 2380. This
  document assumes these default ports. However, they are configurable through
  the kubeadm config file.
* Each host must have systemd and a bash compatible shell installed.
* Each host must [have a container runtime, kubelet, and kubeadm installed](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/).
* Each host should have access to the Kubernetes container image registry (`registry.k8s.io`) or list/pull the required etcd image using
  `kubeadm config images list/pull`. This guide will set up etcd instances as
  [static pods](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/static-pod/) managed by a kubelet.
* Some infrastructure to copy files between hosts. For example `ssh` and `scp`
  can satisfy this requirement.

## Setting up the cluster

The general approach is to generate all certs on one node and only distribute
the *necessary* files to the other nodes.

> **Note:**
> kubeadm contains all the necessary cryptographic machinery to generate
> the certificates described below; no other cryptographic tooling is required for
> this example.

> **Note:**
> The examples below use IPv4 addresses but you can also configure kubeadm, the kubelet and etcd
> to use IPv6 addresses. Dual-stack is supported by some Kubernetes options, but not by etcd. For more details
> on Kubernetes dual-stack support see [Dual-stack support with kubeadm](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/dual-stack-support/).

1. Configure the kubelet to be a service manager for etcd.

   > **Note:**
   > You must do this on every host where etcd should be running.

   Since etcd was created first, you must override the service priority by creating a new unit file
   that has higher precedence than the kubeadm-provided kubelet unit file.

   ```
   cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubelet.conf
   # Replace "systemd" with the cgroup driver of your container runtime. The default value in the kubelet is "cgroupfs".
   # Replace the value of "containerRuntimeEndpoint" for a different container runtime if needed.
   #
   apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: KubeletConfiguration
   authentication:
     anonymous:
       enabled: false
     webhook:
       enabled: false
   authorization:
     mode: AlwaysAllow
   cgroupDriver: systemd
   address: 127.0.0.1
   containerRuntimeEndpoint: unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
   staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
   EOF

   cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-etcd-service-manager.conf
   [Service]
   ExecStart=
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/kubelet --config=/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubelet.conf
   Restart=always
   EOF

   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl restart kubelet
   ```

   Check the kubelet status to ensure it is running.

   ```
   systemctl status kubelet
   ```
2. Create configuration files for kubeadm.

   Generate one kubeadm configuration file for each host that will have an etcd
   member running on it using the following script.

   ```
   # Update HOST0, HOST1 and HOST2 with the IPs of your hosts
   export HOST0=10.0.0.6
   export HOST1=10.0.0.7
   export HOST2=10.0.0.8

   # Update NAME0, NAME1 and NAME2 with the hostnames of your hosts
   export NAME0="infra0"
   export NAME1="infra1"
   export NAME2="infra2"

   # Create temp directories to store files that will end up on other hosts
   mkdir -p /tmp/${HOST0}/ /tmp/${HOST1}/ /tmp/${HOST2}/

   HOSTS=(${HOST0} ${HOST1} ${HOST2})
   NAMES=(${NAME0} ${NAME1} ${NAME2})

   for i in "${!HOSTS[@]}"; do
   HOST=${HOSTS[$i]}
   NAME=${NAMES[$i]}
   cat << EOF > /tmp/${HOST}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: "kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4"
   kind: InitConfiguration
   nodeRegistration:
       name: ${NAME}
   localAPIEndpoint:
       advertiseAddress: ${HOST}
   ---
   apiVersion: "kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4"
   kind: ClusterConfiguration
   etcd:
       local:
           serverCertSANs:
           - "${HOST}"
           peerCertSANs:
           - "${HOST}"
           extraArgs:
           - name: initial-cluster
             value: ${NAMES[0]}=https://${HOSTS[0]}:2380,${NAMES[1]}=https://${HOSTS[1]}:2380,${NAMES[2]}=https://${HOSTS[2]}:2380
           - name: initial-cluster-state
             value: new
           - name: name
             value: ${NAME}
           - name: listen-peer-urls
             value: https://${HOST}:2380
           - name: listen-client-urls
             value: https://${HOST}:2379
           - name: advertise-client-urls
             value: https://${HOST}:2379
           - name: initial-advertise-peer-urls
             value: https://${HOST}:2380
   EOF
   done
   ```
3. Generate the certificate authority.

   If you already have a CA then the only action that is copying the CA's `crt` and
   `key` file to `/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt` and
   `/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.key`. After those files have been copied,
   proceed to the next step, "Create certificates for each member".

   If you do not already have a CA then run this command on `$HOST0` (where you
   generated the configuration files for kubeadm).

   ```
   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-ca
   ```

   This creates two files:

   * `/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt`
   * `/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.key`
4. Create certificates for each member.

   ```
   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server --config=/tmp/${HOST2}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer --config=/tmp/${HOST2}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client --config=/tmp/${HOST2}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client --config=/tmp/${HOST2}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   cp -R /etc/kubernetes/pki /tmp/${HOST2}/
   # cleanup non-reusable certificates
   find /etc/kubernetes/pki -not -name ca.crt -not -name ca.key -type f -delete

   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server --config=/tmp/${HOST1}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer --config=/tmp/${HOST1}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client --config=/tmp/${HOST1}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client --config=/tmp/${HOST1}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   cp -R /etc/kubernetes/pki /tmp/${HOST1}/
   find /etc/kubernetes/pki -not -name ca.crt -not -name ca.key -type f -delete

   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-server --config=/tmp/${HOST0}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-peer --config=/tmp/${HOST0}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   kubeadm init phase certs etcd-healthcheck-client --config=/tmp/${HOST0}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   kubeadm init phase certs apiserver-etcd-client --config=/tmp/${HOST0}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   # No need to move the certs because they are for HOST0

   # clean up certs that should not be copied off this host
   find /tmp/${HOST2} -name ca.key -type f -delete
   find /tmp/${HOST1} -name ca.key -type f -delete
   ```
5. Copy certificates and kubeadm configs.

   The certificates have been generated and now they must be moved to their
   respective hosts.

   ```
   USER=ubuntu
   HOST=${HOST1}
   scp -r /tmp/${HOST}/* ${USER}@${HOST}:
   ssh ${USER}@${HOST}
   USER@HOST $ sudo -Es
   root@HOST $ chown -R root:root pki
   root@HOST $ mv pki /etc/kubernetes/
   ```
6. Ensure all expected files exist.

   The complete list of required files on `$HOST0` is:

   ```
   /tmp/${HOST0}
   └── kubeadmcfg.yaml
   ---
   /etc/kubernetes/pki
   ├── apiserver-etcd-client.crt
   ├── apiserver-etcd-client.key
   └── etcd
       ├── ca.crt
       ├── ca.key
       ├── healthcheck-client.crt
       ├── healthcheck-client.key
       ├── peer.crt
       ├── peer.key
       ├── server.crt
       └── server.key
   ```

   On `$HOST1`:

   ```
   $HOME
   └── kubeadmcfg.yaml
   ---
   /etc/kubernetes/pki
   ├── apiserver-etcd-client.crt
   ├── apiserver-etcd-client.key
   └── etcd
       ├── ca.crt
       ├── healthcheck-client.crt
       ├── healthcheck-client.key
       ├── peer.crt
       ├── peer.key
       ├── server.crt
       └── server.key
   ```

   On `$HOST2`:

   ```
   $HOME
   └── kubeadmcfg.yaml
   ---
   /etc/kubernetes/pki
   ├── apiserver-etcd-client.crt
   ├── apiserver-etcd-client.key
   └── etcd
       ├── ca.crt
       ├── healthcheck-client.crt
       ├── healthcheck-client.key
       ├── peer.crt
       ├── peer.key
       ├── server.crt
       └── server.key
   ```
7. Create the static pod manifests.

   Now that the certificates and configs are in place it's time to create the
   manifests. On each host run the `kubeadm` command to generate a static manifest
   for etcd.

   ```
   root@HOST0 $ kubeadm init phase etcd local --config=/tmp/${HOST0}/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   root@HOST1 $ kubeadm init phase etcd local --config=$HOME/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   root@HOST2 $ kubeadm init phase etcd local --config=$HOME/kubeadmcfg.yaml
   ```
8. Optional: Check the cluster health.

   If `etcdctl` isn't available, you can run this tool inside a container image.
   You would do that directly with your container runtime using a tool such as
   `crictl run` and not through Kubernetes

   ```
   ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
   --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.crt \
   --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.key \
   --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
   --endpoints https://${HOST0}:2379 endpoint health
   ...
   https://[HOST0 IP]:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 16.283339ms
   https://[HOST1 IP]:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 19.44402ms
   https://[HOST2 IP]:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 35.926451ms
   ```

   * Set `${HOST0}`to the IP address of the host you are testing.

## What's next

Once you have an etcd cluster with 3 working members, you can continue setting up a
highly available control plane using the
[external etcd method with kubeadm](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/).
