# Opening a pull request

> **Note:**
> **Code developers**: If you are documenting a new feature for an
> upcoming Kubernetes release, see
> [Document a new feature](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/).

To contribute new content pages or improve existing content pages, open a pull request (PR).
Make sure you follow all the requirements in the
[Before you begin](/docs/contribute/new-content/) section.

If your change is small, or you're unfamiliar with git, read
[Changes using GitHub](#changes-using-github) to learn how to edit a page.

If your changes are large, read [Work from a local fork](#fork-the-repo) to learn how to make
changes locally on your computer.

## Changes using GitHub

If you're less experienced with git workflows, here's an easier method of
opening a pull request. Figure 1 outlines the steps and the details follow.

```

Figure 1. Steps for opening a PR using GitHub.

1. On the page where you see the issue, select the **Edit this page** option in the right-hand side navigation panel.
2. Make your changes in the GitHub markdown editor.
3. On the right above the editor, Select **Commit changes**.
   In the first field, give your commit message a title.
   In the second field, provide a description.

   > **Note:**
   > Do not use any [GitHub Keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)
   > in your commit message. You can add those to the pull request description later.
4. Select **Propose changes**.
5. Select **Create pull request**.
6. The **Open a pull request** screen appears. Fill in the form:

   * The **Add a title** field of the pull request defaults to the commit summary.
     You can change it if needed.
   * The **Add a description** field contains your extended commit message, if you have one,
     and some template text. Add the
     details the template text asks for, then delete the extra template text.
   * Leave the **Allow edits from maintainers** checkbox selected.

   > **Note:**
   > PR descriptions are a great way to help reviewers understand your change.
   > For more information, see [Opening a PR](#open-a-pr).
7. Select **Create pull request**.

### Addressing feedback in GitHub

Before merging a pull request, Kubernetes community members review and
approve it. The `k8s-ci-robot` suggests reviewers based on the nearest
owner mentioned in the pages. If you have someone specific in mind,
leave a comment with their GitHub username in it.

If a reviewer asks you to make changes:

1. Go to the **Files changed** tab.
2. Select the pencil (edit) icon on any files changed by the pull request.
3. Make the changes requested.
4. Commit the changes.

If you are waiting on a reviewer, reach out once every 7 days. You can also post a message in the
`#sig-docs` Slack channel.

When your review is complete, a reviewer merges your PR and your changes go live a few minutes later.

## Work from a local fork

If you're more experienced with git, or if your changes are larger than a few lines,
work from a local fork.

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed
on your computer. You can also use a git UI application.

Figure 2 shows the steps to follow when you work from a local fork. The details for each step follow.

Figure 2. Working from a local fork to make your changes.

### Fork the kubernetes/website repository

1. Navigate to the [`kubernetes/website`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/) repository.
2. Select **Fork**.

### Create a local clone and set the upstream

1. In a terminal window, clone your fork and update the [Docsy Hugo theme](https://github.com/google/docsy#readme):

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:<github_username>/website
   cd website
   ```
2. Navigate to the new `website` directory. Set the `kubernetes/website` repository as the `upstream` remote:

   ```
   cd website

   git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git
   ```
3. Confirm your `origin` and `upstream` repositories:

   ```
   git remote -v
   ```

   Output is similar to:

   ```
   origin	git@github.com:<github_username>/website.git (fetch)
   origin	git@github.com:<github_username>/website.git (push)
   upstream	https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git (fetch)
   upstream	https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git (push)
   ```
4. Fetch commits from your fork's `origin/main` and `kubernetes/website`'s `upstream/main`:

   ```
   git fetch origin
   git fetch upstream
   ```

   This makes sure your local repository is up to date before you start making changes.

   > **Note:**
   > This workflow is different than the
   > [Kubernetes Community GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md).
   > You do not need to merge your local copy of `main` with `upstream/main` before pushing updates
   > to your fork.

### Create a branch

1. Decide which branch to base your work on:

   * For improvements to existing content, use `upstream/main`.
   * For new content about existing features, use `upstream/main`.
   * For localized content, use the localization's conventions. For more information, see
     [localizing Kubernetes documentation](/docs/contribute/localization/).
   * For new features in an upcoming Kubernetes release, use the feature branch. For more
     information, see [documenting for a release](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/).
   * For long-running efforts that multiple SIG Docs contributors collaborate on,
     like content reorganization, use a specific feature branch created for that effort.

   If you need help choosing a branch, ask in the `#sig-docs` Slack channel.
2. Create a new branch based on the branch identified in step 1. This example assumes the base
   branch is `upstream/main`:

   ```
   git checkout -b <my_new_branch> upstream/main
   ```
3. Make your changes using a text editor.

At any time, use the `git status` command to see what files you've changed.

### Commit your changes

When you are ready to submit a pull request, commit your changes.

1. In your local repository, check which files you need to commit:

   ```
   git status
   ```

   Output is similar to:

   ```
   On branch <my_new_branch>
   Your branch is up to date with 'origin/<my_new_branch>'.

   Changes not staged for commit:
   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

   modified:   content/en/docs/contribute/new-content/contributing-content.md

   no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
   ```
2. Add the files listed under **Changes not staged for commit** to the commit:

   ```
   git add <your_file_name>
   ```

   Repeat this for each file.
3. After adding all the files, create a commit:

   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

   > **Note:**
   > Do not use any [GitHub Keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)
   > in your commit message. You can add those to the pull request
   > description later.
4. Push your local branch and its new commit to your remote fork:

   ```
   git push origin <my_new_branch>
   ```

### Preview your changes locally

It's a good idea to preview your changes locally before pushing them or opening a pull request.
A preview lets you catch build errors or markdown formatting problems.

You can either build the website's container image or run Hugo locally. Building the container
image is slower but displays [Hugo shortcodes](/docs/contribute/style/hugo-shortcodes/), which can
be useful for debugging.

* Hugo in a container
  * Hugo on the command line

> **Note:**
> The commands below use Docker as default container engine. Set the `CONTAINER_ENGINE` environment
> variable to override this behaviour.

1. Build the container image locally
   *You only need this step if you are testing a change to the Hugo tool itself*

   ```
   # Run this in a terminal (if required)
   make container-image
   ```
2. Fetch submodule dependencies in your local repository:

   ```
   # Run this in a terminal
   make module-init
   ```
3. Start Hugo in a container:

   ```
   # Run this in a terminal
   make container-serve
   ```
4. In a web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:1313`. Hugo watches the
   changes and rebuilds the site as needed.
5. To stop the local Hugo instance, go back to the terminal and type `Ctrl+C`,
   or close the terminal window.

Alternately, install and use the `hugo` command on your computer:

1. Install the [Hugo (Extended edition)](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) version specified in
   [`website/netlify.toml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/netlify.toml).
2. Install any dependencies:

   ```
   npm ci
   ```
3. In a terminal, go to your Kubernetes website repository and start the Hugo server:

   ```
   cd <path_to_your_repo>/website
   make serve
   ```

   If you're on a Windows machine or unable to run the `make` command, use the following command:

   ```
   hugo server --buildFuture
   ```
4. In a web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:1313`. Hugo watches the
   changes and rebuilds the site as needed.
5. To stop the local Hugo instance, go back to the terminal and type `Ctrl+C`,
   or close the terminal window.

### Open a pull request from your fork to kubernetes/website

Figure 3 shows the steps to open a PR from your fork to the [kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website). The details follow.

Please, note that contributors can mention `kubernetes/website` as `k/website`.

```

Figure 3. Steps to open a PR from your fork to the [kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website).

1. In a web browser, go to the [`kubernetes/website`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/) repository.
2. Select **New Pull Request**.
3. Select **compare across forks**.
4. From the **head repository** drop-down menu, select your fork.
5. From the **compare** drop-down menu, select your branch.
6. Select **Create Pull Request**.
7. Add a description for your pull request:

   * **Title** (50 characters or less): Summarize the intent of the change.
   * **Description**: Describe the change in more detail.

     + If there is a related GitHub issue, include `Fixes #12345` or `Closes #12345` in the
       description. GitHub's automation closes the mentioned issue after merging the PR if used.
       If there are other related PRs, link those as well.
     + If you want advice on something specific, include any questions you'd like reviewers to
       think about in your description.
8. Select the **Create pull request** button.

Congratulations! Your pull request is available in [Pull requests](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pulls).

After opening a PR, GitHub runs automated tests and tries to deploy a preview using
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

* If the Netlify build fails, select **Details** for more information.
* If the Netlify build succeeds, select **Details** opens a staged version of the Kubernetes
  website with your changes applied. This is how reviewers check your changes.

GitHub also automatically assigns labels to a PR, to help reviewers. You can add them too, if
needed. For more information, see [Adding and removing issue labels](/docs/contribute/review/for-approvers/#adding-and-removing-issue-labels).

### Addressing feedback locally

1. After making your changes, amend your previous commit:

   ```
   git commit -a --amend
   ```

   * `-a`: commits all changes
   * `--amend`: amends the previous commit, rather than creating a new one
2. Update your commit message if needed.
3. Use `git push origin <my_new_branch>` to push your changes and re-run the Netlify tests.

   > **Note:**
   > If you use `git commit -m` instead of amending, you must [squash your commits](#squashing-commits)
   > before merging.

#### Changes from reviewers

Sometimes reviewers commit to your pull request. Before making any other changes, fetch those commits.

1. Fetch commits from your remote fork and rebase your working branch:

   ```
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/<your-branch-name>
   ```
2. After rebasing, force-push new changes to your fork:

   ```
   git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

#### Merge conflicts and rebasing

> **Note:**
> For more information, see [Git Branching - Basic Branching and Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#_basic_merge_conflicts),
> [Advanced Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Advanced-Merging), or ask in the
> `#sig-docs` Slack channel for help.

If another contributor commits changes to the same file in another PR, it can create a merge
conflict. You must resolve all merge conflicts in your PR.

1. Update your fork and rebase your local branch:

   ```
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/<your-branch-name>
   ```

   Then force-push the changes to your fork:

   ```
   git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch-name>
   ```
2. Fetch changes from `kubernetes/website`'s `upstream/main` and rebase your branch:

   ```
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
3. Inspect the results of the rebase:

   ```
   git status
   ```

   This results in a number of files marked as conflicted.
4. Open each conflicted file and look for the conflict markers: `>>>`, `<<<`, and `===`.
   Resolve the conflict and delete the conflict marker.

   > **Note:**
   > For more information, see [How conflicts are presented](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_how_conflicts_are_presented).
5. Add the files to the changeset:

   ```
   git add <filename>
   ```
6. Continue the rebase:

   ```
   git rebase --continue
   ```
7. Repeat steps 2 to 5 as needed.

   After applying all commits, the `git status` command shows that the rebase is complete.
8. Force-push the branch to your fork:

   ```
   git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

   The pull request no longer shows any conflicts.

### Squashing commits

> **Note:**
> For more information, see [Git Tools - Rewriting History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History),
> or ask in the `#sig-docs` Slack channel for help.

If your PR has multiple commits, you must squash them into a single commit before merging your PR.
You can check the number of commits on your PR's **Commits** tab or by running the `git log`
command locally.

> **Note:**
> This topic assumes `vim` as the command line text editor.

1. Start an interactive rebase:

   ```
   git rebase -i HEAD~<number_of_commits_in_branch>
   ```

   Squashing commits is a form of rebasing. The `-i` switch tells git you want to rebase interactively.
   `HEAD~<number_of_commits_in_branch` indicates how many commits to look at for the rebase.

   Output is similar to:

   ```
   pick d875112ca Original commit
   pick 4fa167b80 Address feedback 1
   pick 7d54e15ee Address feedback 2

   # Rebase 3d18sf680..7d54e15ee onto 3d183f680 (3 commands)

   ...

   # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
   ```

   The first section of the output lists the commits in the rebase. The second section lists the
   options for each commit. Changing the word `pick` changes the status of the commit once the rebase
   is complete.

   For the purposes of rebasing, focus on `squash` and `pick`.

   > **Note:**
   > For more information, see [Interactive Mode](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode).
2. Start editing the file.

   Change the original text:

   ```
   pick d875112ca Original commit
   pick 4fa167b80 Address feedback 1
   pick 7d54e15ee Address feedback 2
   ```

   To:

   ```
   pick d875112ca Original commit
   squash 4fa167b80 Address feedback 1
   squash 7d54e15ee Address feedback 2
   ```

   This squashes commits `4fa167b80 Address feedback 1` and `7d54e15ee Address feedback 2` into
   `d875112ca Original commit`, leaving only `d875112ca Original commit` as a part of the timeline.
3. Save and exit your file.
4. Push your squashed commit:

   ```
   git push --force-with-lease origin <branch_name>
   ```

## Contribute to other repos

The [Kubernetes project](https://github.com/kubernetes) contains 50+ repositories. Many of these
repositories contain documentation: user-facing help text, error messages, API references or code
comments.

If you see text you'd like to improve, use GitHub to search all repositories in the Kubernetes
organization. This can help you figure out where to submit your issue or PR.

Each repository has its own processes and procedures. Before you file an issue or submit a PR,
read that repository's `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `code-of-conduct.md`, if they exist.

Most repositories use issue and PR templates. Have a look through some open issues and PRs to get
a feel for that team's processes. Make sure to fill out the templates with as much detail as
possible when you file issues or PRs.
