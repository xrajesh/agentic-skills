# Enabling remote health reporting

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

If you or your organization have disabled remote health reporting, you can enable this feature again. You can see that remote health reporting is disabled from the message `Insights not available` in the **Status** tile on the OpenShift Container Platform web console **Overview** page.

</div>

To enable remote health reporting, you must change the global cluster pull secret with a new authorization token. Enabling remote health reporting enables both Insights Operator and Telemetry.

# Changing your global cluster pull secret to enable remote health reporting

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can change your existing global cluster pull secret to enable remote health reporting. If you have disabled remote health monitoring, you must download a new pull secret with your `console.openshift.com` access token from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- Access to OpenShift Cluster Manager.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Go to the [Downloads](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.

2.  From **Tokens** → **Pull secret**, click the **Download** button.

    The `pull-secret` file contains your `cloud.openshift.com` access token in JSON format:

    ``` json
    {
      "auths": {
        "cloud.openshift.com": {
          "auth": "<your_token>",
          "email": "<email_address>"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  Download the global cluster pull secret to your local file system.

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config \
      --template='{{index .data ".dockerconfigjson" | base64decode}}' \
      > pull-secret
    ```

4.  Make a backup copy of your pull secret.

    ``` terminal
    $ cp pull-secret pull-secret-backup
    ```

5.  Open the `pull-secret` file in a text editor.

6.  Append the `cloud.openshift.com` JSON entry from the `pull-secret` file that you downloaded earlier into the `auths` file.

7.  Save the file.

8.  Update the secret in your cluster by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config \
      --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=pull-secret
    ```

    You might need to wait several minutes for the secret to update and your cluster to begin reporting.

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

1.  For a verification check from the OpenShift Container Platform web console, complete the following steps:

    1.  Go to the **Overview** page on the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

    2.  View the **Red Hat Lightspeed** section in the **Status** tile that reports the number of issues found.

2.  For a verification check from the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), enter the following command and then check that the value of the `status` parameter states `false`:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get co insights -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Disabled")]}'
    ```

# Consequences of disabling remote health reporting

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

In OpenShift Container Platform, customers can disable reporting usage information.

</div>

Before you disable remote health reporting, read the following benefits of a connected cluster:

- Red Hat can react more quickly to problems and better support our customers.

- Red Hat can better understand how product upgrades impact clusters.

- Connected clusters help to simplify the subscription and entitlement process.

- Connected clusters enable the OpenShift Cluster Manager service to offer an overview of your clusters and their subscription status.

> [!NOTE]
> Consider leaving health and usage reporting enabled for pre-production, test, and production clusters. This means that Red Hat can participate in qualifying OpenShift Container Platform in your environments and react more rapidly to product issues.

The following lists some consequences of disabling remote health reporting on a connected cluster:

- Red Hat cannot view the success of product upgrades or the health of your clusters without an open support case.

- Red Hat cannot use configuration data to better triage customer support cases and identify which configurations our customers find important.

- The OpenShift Cluster Manager cannot show data about your clusters, which includes health and usage information.

- You must manually enter your subscription information in the `console.redhat.com` web console without the benefit of automatic usage reporting.

In restricted networks, Telemetry and Red Hat Lightspeed data still gets gathered through the appropriate configuration of your proxy.

# Disabling remote health reporting

1.  Download the global cluster pull secret to your local file system:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc extract secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --to=.
    ```

2.  In a text editor, edit the `.dockerconfigjson` file that you downloaded by removing the `cloud.openshift.com` JSON entry:

    ``` json
    "cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"<hash>","email":"<email_address>"}
    ```

3.  Save the file.

4.  Update the secret in your cluster. For more information, see "Updating the global cluster pull secret".

    You might need to wait several minutes for the secret to update in your cluster.

# Updating the global cluster pull secret

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To add new registries or update authentication for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can update the global pull secret by appending new credentials to the *additional-pull-secret*. To do this, you can use the `oc set data secret/additional-pull-secret -n kube-system` command. Hypershift manages the new credential propagation among the HostedCluster nodes.

</div>

Use this procedure when you need a separate registry to store images than the registry used during installation.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Optional: To append a new pull secret to the existing pull secret:

    1.  Download the pull secret by entering the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --template='{{index .data ".dockerconfigjson" | base64decode}}' > <pull_secret_location>
        ```

        where:

        `<pull_secret_location>`
        Specifies the path to the pull secret file.

    2.  Add the new pull secret by entering the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc registry login --registry="<registry>" \
        --auth-basic="<username>:<password>" \
        --to=<pull_secret_location>
        ```

        where:

        `<registry>`
        Specifies the new registry. You can include many repositories within the same registry, for example: `--registry="<registry/my-namespace/my-repository>`.

        `<username>:<password>`
        Specifies the credentials of the new registry.

        `<pull_secret_location>`
        Specifies the path to the pull secret file.

2.  Update the global pull secret for your cluster by entering the following command. Note that this update rolls out to all nodes, which can take some time depending on the size of your cluster.

    ``` terminal
    $ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config \
      --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<pull_secret_location>
    ```

    where:

    `<pull_secret_location>`
    Specifies the path to the new pull secret file.

    This merges your additional pull secret with the original HostedCluster pull secret, making it available to all nodes in the cluster.

3.  Optional: Modify the additional pull secret added by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit secret additional-pull-secret -n kube-system
    ```

    The secret must contain a valid DockerConfigJSON format.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example pull secret

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: additional-pull-secret
      namespace: kube-system
    type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
    data:
      .dockerconfigjson: <base64-encoded-docker-config-json>
    ```

    </div>

    This results in the following states of the each pull secret:

    - **Original**: immutable

    - **Additional**: mutable

    - **Global**: final state of both the original and additional pull secrets

4.  Optional: Delete the additional pull secret added by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc delete secret additional-pull-secret -n kube-system
    ```

    This triggers the automatic cleanup process across your nodes.
