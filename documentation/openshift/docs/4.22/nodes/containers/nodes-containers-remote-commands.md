# Executing remote commands in containers

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to execute remote commands in OpenShift Container Platform containers. By running commands in a container, you can perform troubleshooting, inspect logs, run scripts, and other tasks.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- Use a command similar to the following to run a command in a container:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc exec <pod> [-c <container>] -- <command> [<arg_1> ... <arg_n>]
  ```

  For example:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc exec mypod date
  ```

  <div class="formalpara">

  <div class="title">

  Example output

  </div>

  ``` terminal
  Thu Apr  9 02:21:53 UTC 2015
  ```

  </div>

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > [For security purposes](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015:1650), the `oc exec` command does not work when accessing privileged containers except when the command is executed by a `cluster-admin` user.

# Protocol for initiating a remote command from a client

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

A client resource in your cluster can initiate the execution of a remote command in a container by issuing a request to the Kubernetes API server.

</div>

The following example is the format for a typical request to a Kubernetes API server:

``` terminal
/proxy/nodes/<node_name>/exec/<namespace>/<pod>/<container>?command=<command>
```

where:

`<node_name>`
Specifies the FQDN of the node.

`<namespace>`
Specifies the project of the target pod.

`<pod>`
Specifies the name of the target pod.

`<container>`
Specifies the name of the target container.

`<command>`
Specifies the desired command to be executed.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example request

</div>

``` terminal
/proxy/nodes/node123.openshift.com/exec/myns/mypod/mycontainer?command=date
```

</div>

Additionally, the client can add parameters to the request to indicate any of the following conditions:

- The client should send input to the remote container’s command (stdin).

- The client’s terminal is a TTY.

- The remote container’s command should send output from stdout to the client.

- The remote container’s command should send output from stderr to the client.

After sending an `exec` request to the API server, the client upgrades the connection to one that supports multiplexed streams; the current implementation uses **HTTP/2**.

The client creates one stream each for stdin, stdout, and stderr. To distinguish among the streams, the client sets the `streamType` header on the stream to one of `stdin`, `stdout`, or `stderr`.

The client closes all streams, the upgraded connection, and the underlying connection when it is finished with the remote command execution request.
