You can view events in OpenShift Container Platform, which are based on events that happen to API objects in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

# Understanding events

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Review the following information to learn how OpenShift Container Platform uses *events* to record information about real-world events in a resource-agnostic manner. Events also allow developers and administrators to consume information about system components in a unified way.

# Viewing events using the CLI

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can get a list of events in a given project by using the CLI.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- View events in a project by using a command similar to the following:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get events [-n <project>]
  ```

  where:

  `project`
  Specifies the name of the project.

  For example:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get events -n openshift-config
  ```

  </div>

- View events in your project from the OpenShift Container Platform console:

  1.  Launch the OpenShift Container Platform console.

  2.  Click **Home** → **Events** and select your project.

  3.  Move to resource that you want to see events. For example: **Home** → **Projects** → \<project-name\> → \<resource-name\>.

      Many objects, such as pods and deployments, also have an **Events** tab, which shows events related to that object.
