The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator exposes ready-to-use metrics that it pulls from the on-cluster monitoring component. You can query the metrics by using the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to analyze and diagnose issues. All metrics are reset when the controller pod restarts.

# Accessing performance metrics

You can access the metrics and run queries by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.
