# Understanding secrets

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can mount secrets into containers by using a volume plugin or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.

</div>

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such as passwords, OpenShift Container Platform client configuration files, private source repository credentials, and so on. Secrets decouple sensitive content from the pods.

Key properties include:

- Secret data can be referenced independently from its definition.

- Secret data volumes are backed by temporary file-storage facilities (tmpfs) and never come to rest on a node.

- Secret data can be shared within a namespace.

YAML `Secret` object definition

</div>

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: test-secret
  namespace: my-namespace
type: Opaque
data:
  username: <username>
  password: <password>
stringData:
  hostname: myapp.mydomain.com
```

</div>

where:

`type`
Specifies the structure of the secret’s key names and values.

`data`
Specifies the allowable format for the keys in the `data` field must meet the guidelines in the **DNS_SUBDOMAIN** value as described in "Identifiers and Names in Kubernetes" in the Kubernetes documentation.

`data.username`
Specifies the value associated with keys in the `data` map. This value must be base64 encoded.

`data.passsword`
Specifies the value associated with keys in the `data` map. This value must be base64 encoded.

`stringData.hostname`
Specifies the value associated with keys in the `data` map. The value associated with keys in the `stringData` map is made up of plain text strings. Entries in the `stringData` map are converted to base64 and the entry will then be moved to the `data` map automatically. This field is write-only; the value will only be returned via the `data` field.

You must create a secret before creating the pods that depend on that secret.

When creating secrets:

- Create a secret object with secret data.

- Update the pod’s service account to allow the reference to the secret.

- Create a pod, which consumes the secret as an environment variable or as a file (using a `secret` volume).

## Types of secrets

The value in the `type` field indicates the structure of the secret’s key names and values. The type can be used to enforce the presence of user names and keys in the secret object. If you do not want validation, use the `opaque` type, which is the default.

Specify one of the following types to trigger minimal server-side validation to ensure the presence of specific key names in the secret data:

- `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`: Use with Basic authentication

- `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`: Use as an image pull secret

- `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`: Use as an image pull secret

- `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`: Use to obtain a legacy service account API token

- `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`: Use with SSH key authentication

- `kubernetes.io/tls`: Use with TLS certificate authorities

Specify `type: Opaque` if you do not want validation, which means the secret does not claim to conform to any convention for key names or values. An *opaque* secret, allows for unstructured `key:value` pairs that can contain arbitrary values.

> [!NOTE]
> You can specify other arbitrary types, such as `example.com/my-secret-type`. These types are not enforced server-side, but indicate that the creator of the secret intended to conform to the key/value requirements of that type.

For examples of creating different types of secrets, see *Understanding how to create secrets*.

## Secret data keys

Secret keys must be in a DNS subdomain.

## Automatically generated image pull secrets

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

OpenShift Container Platform automatically creates image pull secrets for each service account to integrate the internal image registry with user authentication.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, a long-lived service account API token secret was also generated for each service account that was created. Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, this service account API token secret is no longer created.
>
> After upgrading to 4.17, any existing long-lived service account API token secrets are not deleted and will continue to function. For information about detecting long-lived API tokens that are in use in your cluster or deleting them if they are not needed, see "Long-lived service account API tokens in OpenShift Container Platform (Red Hat Knowledgebase)".

This image pull secret is necessary to integrate the OpenShift image registry into the cluster’s user authentication and authorization system.

However, if you do not enable the `ImageRegistry` capability or if you disable the integrated OpenShift image registry in the Cluster Image Registry Operator’s configuration, an image pull secret is not generated for each service account.

When the integrated OpenShift image registry is disabled on a cluster that previously had it enabled, the previously generated image pull secrets are deleted automatically.

# Understanding how to create secrets

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

As an administrator you must create a secret before developers can create the pods that depend on that secret.

</div>

To use a secret, a pod needs to reference the secret. A secret can be used with a pod in three ways:

- To populate environment variables for containers.

- As files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers.

- By kubelet when pulling images for the pod.

Volume type secrets write data into the container as a file using the volume mechanism. Image pull secrets use service accounts for the automatic injection of the secret into all pods in a namespace.

When a template contains a secret definition, the only way for the template to use the provided secret is to ensure that the secret volume sources are validated and that the specified object reference actually points to a `Secret` object. Therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it. The most effective way to ensure this is to have it get injected automatically through the use of a service account.

Secret API objects reside in a namespace. They can only be referenced by pods in that same namespace.

Individual secrets are limited to 1MB in size. This is to discourage the creation of large secrets that could exhaust apiserver and kubelet memory. However, creation of several smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.

# Understanding how to update secrets

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To update the values in a secret, you must re-create the pods that use that secret. Because running pods do not automatically detect changes to secret data, restarting the pods ensures they consume the updated configuration.

</div>

Updating a secret follows the same workflow as deploying a new container image. You can use the `kubectl rolling-update` command.

The `resourceVersion` value in a secret is not specified when it is referenced. Therefore, if a secret is updated at the same time as pods are starting, the version of the secret that is used for the pod is not defined.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, it is not possible to check the resource version of a secret object that was used when a pod was created. It is planned that pods will report this information, so that a controller could restart ones using an old `resourceVersion`. In the interim, do not update the data of existing secrets, but create new ones with distinct names.

    Replace `<sa_token_secret>` with the name of your service token secret.

5.  Use your service account token to authenticate with the API of your cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ curl -X GET <openshift_cluster_api> --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
    ```

    Replace `<openshift_cluster_api>` with the OpenShift cluster API and replace `<token>` with the service account token that is output in the preceding command.

# About using signed certificates with secrets

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To secure communication to your service, you can configure OpenShift Container Platform to generate a signed serving certificate/key pair that you can add into a secret in a project.

</div>

A *service serving certificate secret* is intended to support complex middleware applications that need out-of-the-box certificates. It has the same settings as the server certificates generated by the administrator tooling for nodes and masters.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Service `Pod` spec configured for a service serving certificates secret.

</div>

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: registry
  annotations:
    service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: registry-cert
# ...
```

</div>

Replace `registry-cert` with a name for the certificate

Other pods can trust cluster-created certificates (which are only signed for internal DNS names), by using the CA bundle in the ***/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt*** file that is automatically mounted in their pod.

The signature algorithm for this feature is `x509.SHA256WithRSA`. To manually rotate, delete the generated secret. A new certificate is created.

## Generating signed certificates for use with secrets

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use a signed serving certificate/key pair with a pod by adding the `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` annotation to the service, then add the secret to the pod.

</div>

Use the following procedure to create a *service serving certificate secret*.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Edit the `Pod` spec for your service.

2.  Add the `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` annotation with the name you want to use for your secret.

    ``` yaml
    kind: Service
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: my-service
      annotations:
          service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: my-cert
    spec:
      selector:
        app: MyApp
      ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 80
        targetPort: 9376
    ```

    Replace `my-cert` with the name for the secret. The certificate and key are in PEM format, stored in `tls.crt` and `tls.key` respectively.

3.  Create the service:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
    ```

4.  View the secret to make sure it was created:

    1.  View a list of all secrets:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get secrets
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

        Example output

        </div>

        ``` terminal
        NAME                     TYPE                                  DATA      AGE
        my-cert                  kubernetes.io/tls                     2         9m
        ```

        </div>

    2.  View details on your secret:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc describe secret my-cert
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

        Example output

        </div>

        ``` terminal
        Name:         my-cert
        Namespace:    openshift-console
        Labels:       <none>
        Annotations:  service.beta.openshift.io/expiry: 2023-03-08T23:22:40Z
                      service.beta.openshift.io/originating-service-name: my-service
                      service.beta.openshift.io/originating-service-uid: 640f0ec3-afc2-4380-bf31-a8c784846a11
                      service.beta.openshift.io/expiry: 2023-03-08T23:22:40Z

        Type:  kubernetes.io/tls

        Data
        ====
        tls.key:  1679 bytes
        tls.crt:  2595 bytes
        ```

        </div>

5.  Edit your `Pod` spec with that secret.

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-service-pod
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
      containers:
      - name: mypod
        image: redis
        volumeMounts:
        - name: my-container
          mountPath: "/etc/my-path"
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          capabilities:
            drop: [ALL]
      volumes:
      - name: my-volume
        secret:
          secretName: my-cert
          items:
          - key: username
            path: my-group/my-username
            mode: 511
    ```

    When it is available, your pod will run. The certificate will be good for the internal service DNS name, `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc`.

    The certificate/key pair is automatically replaced when it gets close to expiration. View the expiration date in the `service.beta.openshift.io/expiry` annotation on the secret, which is in RFC3339 format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In most cases, the service DNS name `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc` is not externally routable. The primary use of `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc` is for intracluster or intraservice communication, and with re-encrypt routes.

</div>

# Troubleshooting secrets

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Review the following information for troubleshooting tips for working with secrets.

</div>

If a service certificate generation fails with (service’s `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error` annotation contains):

``` terminal
secret/ssl-key references serviceUID 62ad25ca-d703-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b608, which does not match 77b6dd80-d716-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b60
```

The service that generated the certificate no longer exists, or has a different `serviceUID`. You must force certificates regeneration by removing the old secret, and clearing the following annotations on the service `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error`, `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num`:

1.  Delete the secret:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc delete secret <secret_name>
    ```

2.  Clear the annotations:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num-
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The command removing annotation has a `-` after the annotation name to be removed.
