# Listing the Kubernetes API group versions on a cluster

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Identify the preferred Kubernetes API group versions on your source cluster. This helps you select the correct API version when multiple API versions are available for a single API.

</div>

A source cluster might offer multiple versions of an API, where one of these versions is the preferred API version. For example, a source cluster with an API named `Example` might be available in the `example.com/v1` and `example.com/v1beta2` API groups.

If you use Velero to back up and restore such a source cluster, Velero backs up only the version of that resource that uses the preferred version of its Kubernetes API.

To return to the above example, if `example.com/v1` is the preferred API, then Velero only backs up the version of a resource that uses `example.com/v1`. Moreover, the target cluster needs to have `example.com/v1` registered in its set of available API resources in order for Velero to restore the resource on the target cluster.

Therefore, you need to generate a list of the Kubernetes API group versions on your target cluster to be sure the preferred API version is registered in its set of available API resources.

# About Enable API Group Versions

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Enable the API Group Versions feature to back up all supported Kubernetes API versions on your cluster, rather than just the preferred one. This helps you maintain complete API compatibility when restoring data to a destination cluster.

</div>

By default, Velero only backs up resources that use the preferred version of the Kubernetes API. However, Velero also includes the Enable API Group Versions feature that overcomes this limitation. When enabled on the source cluster, this feature causes Velero to back up *all* Kubernetes API group versions that are supported on the cluster, not only the preferred one. After the versions are stored in the backup .tar file, they are available to be restored on the destination cluster.

For example, a source cluster with an API named `Example` might be available in the `example.com/v1` and `example.com/v1beta2` API groups, with `example.com/v1` being the preferred API.

Without the Enable API Group Versions feature enabled, Velero backs up only the preferred API group version for `Example`, which is `example.com/v1`. With the feature enabled, Velero also backs up `example.com/v1beta2`.

When the Enable API Group Versions feature is enabled on the destination cluster, Velero selects the version to restore on the basis of the order of priority of API group versions.

> [!NOTE]
> Enable API Group Versions is still in beta.

Velero uses the following algorithm to assign priorities to API versions, with `1` as the top priority:

1.  Preferred version of the *destination* cluster

2.  Preferred version of the source\_ cluster

3.  Common non-preferred supported version with the highest Kubernetes version priority

# Using Enable API Group Versions

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Configure the `EnableAPIGroupVersions` feature flag to back up all Kubernetes API group versions that are supported on a cluster, not only the preferred one. This helps you maintain compatibility across different API groups in your cluster.

- Configure the `EnableAPIGroupVersions` feature flag:

  ``` yaml
  apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/vialpha1
  kind: DataProtectionApplication
  ...
  spec:
    configuration:
      velero:
        featureFlags:
