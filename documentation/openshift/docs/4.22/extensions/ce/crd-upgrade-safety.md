When you update a custom resource definition (CRD) that is provided by a cluster extension, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 runs a CRD upgrade safety preflight check to ensure backwards compatibility with previous versions of that CRD. The CRD update must pass the validation checks before the change is allowed to progress on a cluster.

# Prohibited CRD upgrade changes

The following changes to an existing custom resource definition (CRD) are caught by the CRD upgrade safety preflight check and prevent the upgrade:

- A new required field is added to an existing version of the CRD

- An existing field is removed from an existing version of the CRD

- An existing field type is changed in an existing version of the CRD

- A new default value is added to a field that did not previously have a default value

- The default value of a field is changed

- An existing default value of a field is removed

- New enum restrictions are added to an existing field which did not previously have enum restrictions

- Existing enum values from an existing field are removed

- The minimum value of an existing field is increased in an existing version

- The maximum value of an existing field is decreased in an existing version

- Minimum or maximum field constraints are added to a field that did not previously have constraints

> [!NOTE]
> The rules for changes to minimum and maximum values apply to `minimum`, `minLength`, `minProperties`, `minItems`, `maximum`, `maxLength`, `maxProperties`, and `maxItems` constraints.

The following changes to an existing CRD are reported by the CRD upgrade safety preflight check and prevent the upgrade, though the operations are technically handled by the Kubernetes API server:

- The scope changes from `Cluster` to `Namespace` or from `Namespace` to `Cluster`

- An existing stored version of the CRD is removed

If the CRD upgrade safety preflight check encounters one of the prohibited upgrade changes, it logs an error for each prohibited change detected in the CRD upgrade.

> [!TIP]
> In cases where a change to the CRD does not fall into one of the prohibited change categories, but is also unable to be properly detected as allowed, the CRD upgrade safety preflight check will prevent the upgrade and log an error for an "unknown change".

# Allowed CRD upgrade changes

The following changes to an existing custom resource definition (CRD) are safe for backwards compatibility and will not cause the CRD upgrade safety preflight check to halt the upgrade:

- Adding new enum values to the list of allowed enum values in a field

- An existing required field is changed to optional in an existing version

- The minimum value of an existing field is decreased in an existing version

- The maximum value of an existing field is increased in an existing version

- A new version of the CRD is added with no modifications to existing versions

# Disabling the CRD upgrade safety preflight check

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can disable the custom resource definition (CRD) upgrade safety preflight check. In the `ClusterExtension` object that provides the CRD, set the `install.preflight.crdUpgradeSafety.enforcement` field with the value of `None`.

</div>

> [!WARNING]
> Disabling the CRD upgrade safety preflight check could break backwards compatibility with stored versions of the CRD and cause other unintended consequences on the cluster.

You cannot disable individual field validators. If you disable the CRD upgrade safety preflight check, you disable all field validators.

> [!NOTE]
> If you disable the CRD upgrade safety preflight check in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1, the Kubernetes API server still prevents the following operations:
>
> - Changing scope from `Cluster` to `Namespace` or from `Namespace` to `Cluster`
>
> - Removing an existing stored version of the CRD

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have a cluster extension installed.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Edit the `ClusterExtension` object of the CRD:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit clusterextension <clusterextension_name>
    ```

2.  Set the `install.preflight.crdUpgradeSafety.enforcement` field to `None`:

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example `ClusterExtension` object

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1

# Examples of unsafe CRD changes

The following examples demonstrate specific changes to sections of an example custom resource definition (CRD) that would be caught by the CRD upgrade safety preflight check.

For the following examples, consider a CRD object in the following starting state:

<div class="example">

<div class="title">

Example CRD object

</div>

``` yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  annotations:
    controller-gen.kubebuilder.io/version: v0.13.0
  name: example.test.example.com
spec:
  group: test.example.com
  names:
    kind: Sample
    listKind: SampleList
    plural: samples
    singular: sample
  scope: Namespaced
  versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        properties:
