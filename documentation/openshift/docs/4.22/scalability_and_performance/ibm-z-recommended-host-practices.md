# Managing CPU overcommitment

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To optimize infrastructure sizing in a highly virtualized IBM Z environment, manage CPU overcommitment. By adopting this strategy, you can allocate more resources to virtual machines than are physically available at the hypervisor level. This capability requires that you plan carefully for specific workload dependencies.

</div>

Depending on your setup, consider the following best practices regarding CPU overcommitment:

- Avoid over-allocating physical cores, Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFLs), at the Logical Partition (LPAR) level (PR/SM hypervisor). If your system has 4 physical IFLs, do not configure multiple LPARs with 4 logical IFLs each.

- Check and understand LPAR shares and weights.

- An excessive number of virtual CPUs can adversely affect performance. Do not define more virtual processors to a guest than logical processors are defined to the LPAR.

- Configure the number of virtual processors per guest for peak workload.

- Start small and monitor the workload. If required, increase the vCPU number incrementally.

- Not all workloads are suitable for high overcommitment ratios. If the workload is CPU intensive, you might experience performance problems with high overcommitment ratios. Workloads that are more I/O intensive can keep consistent performance even with high overcommitment ratios.

# Disable Transparent Huge Pages

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To prevent the operating system from automatically managing memory segments, disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP).

</div>

Transparent Huge Pages (THP) tries to automate most aspects of creating, managing, and using huge pages. Since THP automatically manages the huge pages, THP does not always handle optimally for all types of workloads. THP can lead to performance regressions, since many applications handle huge pages on their own.

# Boosting networking performance with RFS

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To boost networking performance, activate Receive Flow Steering (RFS) by using the Machine Config Operator (MCO). This configuration improves packet processing efficiency.

</div>

RFS extends Receive Packet Steering (RPS) by further reducing network latency. RFS is technically based on RPS, and improves the efficiency of packet processing by increasing the CPU cache hit rate. RFS achieves this, while considering queue length, by determining the most convenient CPU for computation so that cache hits are more likely to occur within the CPU. This means that the CPU cache is invalidated less and requires fewer cycles to rebuild the cache, which reduces packet processing run time.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Copy the following MCO sample profile into a YAML file. For example, `enable-rfs.yaml`:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
      name: 50-enable-rfs
    spec:

            mode: 0644
            path: /etc/sysctl.d/95-enable-rps.conf
    ```

2.  Create the MCO profile by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f enable-rfs.yaml
    ```

3.  Verify that an entry named `50-enable-rfs` is listed by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get mc
    ```

4.  To deactivate the MCO profile, enter the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc delete mc 50-enable-rfs
    ```

# Choose your networking setup

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

For IBM Z® setups, the networking setup depends on the hypervisor of your choice. Depending on the workload and the application, the best fit usually changes with the use case and the traffic pattern.

</div>

The networking stack is one of the most important components for a Kubernetes-based product like OpenShift Container Platform.

Depending on your setup, consider these best practices:

- Consider all options regarding networking devices to optimize your traffic pattern. Explore the advantages of OSA-Express, RoCE Express, HiperSockets, z/VM VSwitch, Linux Bridge (KVM), and others to decide which option leads to the greatest benefit for your setup.

- Always use the latest available NIC version. For example, OSA Express 7S 10 GbE shows great improvement compared to OSA Express 6S 10 GbE with transactional workload types, although both are 10 GbE adapters.

- Each virtual switch adds an additional layer of latency.

- The load balancer plays an important role for network communication outside the cluster. Consider using a production-grade hardware load balancer if this is critical for your application.

- OpenShift Container Platform OVN-Kubernetes network plugin introduces flows and rules, which impact the networking performance. Make sure to consider pod affinities and placements, to benefit from the locality of services where communication is critical.

- Balance the trade-off between performance and functionality.

# Ensure high disk performance with HyperPAV on z/VM

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To improve I/O performance for Direct Access Storage Devices (DASD) disks in z/VM environments, configure HyperPAV alias devices. To increase throughput for both control plane nodes and compute nodes, add YAML configurations with full-pack minidisks to the Machine Config Operator (MCO) profiles for IBM Z clusters.

</div>

DASD and Extended Count Key Data (ECKD) devices are commonly used disk types in IBM Z® environments. In a typical OpenShift Container Platform setup in z/VM environments, DASD disks are commonly used to support the local storage for the nodes. You can set up HyperPAV alias devices to provide more throughput and overall better I/O performance for the DASD disks that support the z/VM guests.

Using HyperPAV for the local storage devices leads to a significant performance benefit. However, be aware of the trade-off between throughput and CPU costs.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Copy the following MCO sample profile into a YAML file for the control plane node. For example, `05-master-kernelarg-hpav.yaml`:

    ``` terminal
    $ cat 05-master-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
      name: 05-master-kernelarg-hpav
    spec:
      config:
        ignition:
          version: 3.1.0
      kernelArguments:
        - rd.dasd=800-805
    # ...
    ```

2.  Copy the following MCO sample profile into a YAML file for the compute node. For example, `05-worker-kernelarg-hpav.yaml`:

    ``` terminal
    $ cat 05-worker-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
      name: 05-worker-kernelarg-hpav
    spec:
      config:
        ignition:
          version: 3.1.0
      kernelArguments:
        - rd.dasd=800-805
    # ...
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must modify the `rd.dasd` arguments to fit the device IDs.

3.  Create the MCO profiles by entering the following commands:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f 05-master-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f 05-worker-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
    ```

4.  To deactivate the MCO profiles, enter the following commands:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc delete -f 05-master-kernelarg-hpav.yaml
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ oc delete -f 05-worker-kernelarg-hpav.yaml

# RHEL KVM on IBM Z host recommendations

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To optimize Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) performance on IBM Z, apply host recommendations.

</div>

Optimizing a KVM virtual server environment strongly depends on the workloads of the virtual servers and on the available resources. The same action that enhances performance in one environment can have adverse effects in another. Finding the best balance for a particular setting can be a challenge and often involves experimentation.

The following sections introduces some best practices when using OpenShift Container Platform with RHEL KVM on IBM Z® and IBM® LinuxONE environments.

## Use I/O threads for your virtual block devices

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To make virtual block devices use I/O threads, you must configure one or more I/O threads for the virtual server and each virtual block device to use one of these I/O threads.

</div>

The following example specifies `<iothreads>3</iothreads>` to configure three I/O threads, with consecutive decimal thread IDs 1, 2, and 3. The `iothread="2"` parameter specifies the driver element of the disk device to use the I/O thread with ID 2.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Sample I/O thread specification

</div>

``` xml
...
<domain>
    <iothreads>3</iothreads>
     ...
        <devices>
       ...
          <disk type="block" device="disk">
<driver ... iothread="2"/>
    </disk>
       ...
        </devices>
   ...
</domain>
```

</div>

where:

`iothreads`
Specifies the number of I/O threads.

`disk`
Specifies the driver element of the disk device.

Threads can increase the performance of I/O operations for disk devices, but they also use memory and CPU resources. You can configure multiple devices to use the same thread. The best mapping of threads to devices depends on the available resources and the workload.

Start with a small number of I/O threads. Often, a single I/O thread for all disk devices is sufficient. Do not configure more threads than the number of virtual CPUs, and do not configure idle threads.

You can use the `virsh iothreadadd` command to add I/O threads with specific thread IDs to a running virtual server.

## Avoid virtual SCSI devices

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Configure virtual SCSI devices only if you need to address the device through SCSI-specific interfaces. Configure disk space as virtual block devices rather than virtual SCSI devices, regardless of the backing on the host.

</div>

However, you might need SCSI-specific interfaces for:

- A logical unit number (LUN) for a SCSI-attached tape drive on the host.

- A DVD ISO file on the host file system that is mounted on a virtual DVD drive.

## Configure guest caching for disk

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To ensure that the guest manages caching instead of the host, configure your disk devices.

</div>

Ensure that the driver element of the disk device includes the `cache="none"` and `io="native"` parameters.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example configuration

</div>

``` xml
<disk type="block" device="disk">
    <driver name="qemu" type="raw" cache="none" io="native" iothread="1"/>
...
</disk>
```

</div>

## Excluding the memory balloon device

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Unless you need a dynamic memory size, do not define a memory balloon device and ensure that libvirt does not create one for you. Include the `memballoon` parameter as a child of the devices element in your domain configuration file.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To disable the memory balloon driver, add the following configuration setting to your domain configuration file:

  ``` xml
  <memballoon model="none"/>
  ```

</div>

## Tuning the CPU migration algorithm of the host scheduler

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can tune the CPU migration algorithm of the host scheduler to meet the demands of your production system.

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not change the scheduler settings unless you are an expert who understands the implications. Do not apply changes to production systems without testing them and confirming that they have the intended effect.

The `kernel.sched_migration_cost_ns` parameter specifies a time interval in nanoseconds. After the last execution of a task, the CPU cache is considered to have useful content until this interval expires. Increasing this interval results in fewer task migrations. The default value is `500000` ns.

If the CPU idle time is higher than expected when there are runnable processes, try reducing this interval. If tasks bounce between CPUs or nodes too often, try increasing it.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To dynamically set the interval to `60000` ns, enter the following command:

  ``` terminal
  # sysctl kernel.sched_migration_cost_ns=60000
  ```

- To persistently change the value to `60000` ns, add the following entry to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

  ``` config
  kernel.sched_migration_cost_ns=60000
  ```

</div>

## Disabling the cpuset cgroup controller

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can disable the cpuset cgroup controller. Disabling the controller requires a restart of the libvirtd daemon.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies only to KVM hosts with cgroups version 1. To enable CPU hotplug on the host, disable the cgroup controller.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Open `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` with an editor of your choice.

2.  Go to the `cgroup_controllers` line.

3.  Duplicate the entire line and remove the leading number sign (#) from the copy.

4.  Remove the `cpuset` entry, as follows:

    ``` config
    cgroup_controllers = [ "cpu", "devices", "memory", "blkio", "cpuacct" ]
    ```

5.  For the new setting to take effect, you must restart the libvirtd daemon:

    1.  Stop all virtual machines.

    2.  Run the following command:

        ``` terminal
        # systemctl restart libvirtd
        ```

    3.  Restart the virtual machines.

        This setting persists across host reboots.

</div>

## Tuning the polling period for idle virtual CPUs

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

When a virtual CPU becomes idle, KVM polls for wakeup conditions for the virtual CPU before allocating the host resource. You can specify the time interval, during which polling takes place in sysfs at `/sys/module/kvm/parameters/halt_poll_ns`.

</div>

During the specified time, polling reduces the wakeup latency for the virtual CPU at the expense of resource usage. Depending on the workload, a longer or shorter time for polling can be beneficial. The time interval is specified in nanoseconds. The default is `50000` ns.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To optimize for low CPU consumption, enter a small value or write `0` to disable polling:

  ``` terminal
  # echo 0 > /sys/module/kvm/parameters/halt_poll_ns
  ```

- To optimize for low latency, for example for transactional workloads, enter a large value:

  ``` terminal
  # echo 80000 > /sys/module/kvm/parameters/halt_poll_ns
  ```
