<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

As a cluster administrator, you can use quotas and limit ranges to set constraints. These constraints limit the number of objects or the amount of compute resources that are used in your project.

</div>

By using quotes and limits, you can better manage and allocate resoures across all projects. You can also ensure that no projects use more resources than is appropriate for the cluster size.

A resource quota, defined by a `ResourceQuota` object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. The quota can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a project by type. Additinally, the quota can limit the total amount of compute resources and storage that might be consumed by resources in that project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Quotas are set by cluster administrators and are scoped to a given project. OpenShift Container Platform project owners can change quotas for their project, but not limit ranges. OpenShift Container Platform users cannot modify quotas or limit ranges.

# Resources managed by quota

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To limit aggregate resource consumption per project, define a `ResourceQuota` object. By using this object, you can restrict the number of created objects by type. You can also restrict the total amount of compute resources and storage consumed within the project.

Object counts managed by quota

You can configure an object count quota for these standard namespaced resource types using the `count/<resource>.<group>` syntax.

``` terminal
$ oc create quota <name> --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>
```

where:

`<resource>`
Specifies the name of the resource.

`<group>`
Specifies the API group, if applicable. You can use the `kubectl api-resources` command for a list of resources and their associated API groups.

# Setting resource quota for extended resources

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To manage the consumption of extended resources, such as `nvidia.com/gpu`, define a resource quota by using the `requests` prefix. Since overcommitment is prohibited for these resources, you must explicitly specify both requests and limits to ensure valid configuration.

Procedure

</div>

1.  To determine how many GPUs are available on a node in your cluster, use the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc describe node ip-172-31-27-209.us-west-2.compute.internal | egrep 'Capacity|Allocatable|gpu'
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    openshift.com/gpu-accelerator=true
    Capacity:
     nvidia.com/gpu:  2
    Allocatable:
     nvidia.com/gpu:  2
     nvidia.com/gpu:  0           0
    ```

    </div>

    In this example, 2 GPUs are available.

2.  Use this command to set a quota in the namespace `nvidia`. In this example, the quota is `1`:

    ``` terminal
    $ cat gpu-quota.yaml
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

4.  Verify that the namespace has the correct quota set using the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc describe quota gpu-quota -n nvidia
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    --------                 ----  ----
    requests.nvidia.com/gpu  1     1
    ```

    </div>

8.  Using the following command, attempt to create a second GPU pod in the `nvidia` namespace. This is technically available on the node because it has 2 GPUs:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f gpu-pod.yaml
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

# Quota scopes

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To restrict the set of resources that a quota applies to, add associated scopes. This configuration limits usage measurement to the intersection of the enumerated scopes, ensuring that specifying a resource outside the allowed set results in a validation error.

</div>

| Scope | Description |
|----|----|
| `Terminating` | Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds >= 0`. |
| `NotTerminating` | Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` is `nil`. |
| `BestEffort` | Match pods that have best effort quality of service for either `cpu` or `memory`. |
| `NotBestEffort` | Match pods that do not have best effort quality of service for `cpu` and `memory`. |

A `BestEffort` scope restricts a quota to limiting the following resources:

- pods

A `Terminating`, `NotTerminating`, and `NotBestEffort` scope restricts a quota to tracking the following resources:

- `pods`

- `memory`

- `requests.memory`

# Admin quota usage

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To ensure projects remain within defined constraints, monitor admin quota usage. After a resource quota for a project is first created, the project restricts the ability to create any new resources that can violate a quota constraint until it has calculated updated usage statistics.

</div>

Quota enforcement
After a resource quota for a project is first created, the project restricts the ability to create any new resources that can violate a quota constraint until the quota has calculated updated usage statistics.

After a quota is created and usage statistics are updated, the project accepts the creation of new content. When you create or modify resources, your quota usage is incremented immediately upon the request to create or modify the resource.

When you delete a resource, your quota use is decremented during the next full recalculation of quota statistics for the project.

A configurable amount of time determines how long the quota takes to reduce quota usage statistics to their current observed system value.

If project modifications exceed a quota usage limit, the server denies the action and returns an appropriate error message to the user. The error message explains the quota constraint violated and what their currently observed usage statistics are in the system.

Requests compared to limits
When allocating compute resources by quota, each container can specify a request and a limit value each for CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage. Quotas can restrict any of these values.

If the quota has a value specified for `requests.cpu` or `requests.memory`, then the quota requires that every incoming container makes an explicit request for those resources. If the quota has a value specified for `limits.cpu` or `limits.memory`, the quota requires that every incoming container specify an explicit limit for those resources.

## Creating a quota

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To create a quota, define a `ResourceQuota` object in a file and apply the file to a project. By doing this task, you can restrict aggregate resource consumption and object counts within the project to ensure the project complies with cluster policies.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To apply resource constraints to a specific project, create a `ResourceQuota` object by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). Run the following `oc create` command with your definition file to enforce the limits on aggregate resource consumption and object counts specified for that namespace:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc create -f <resource_quota_definition> [-n <project_name>]
  ```

  <div class="formalpara">

  <div class="title">

  Example command to create a ResourceQuota object

  </div>

  ``` terminal
  $ oc create -f core-object-counts.yaml -n demoproject
  ```

  </div>

</div>

## Creating object count quotas

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To manage the consumption of standard namespaced resource types, create an object count quota. By creating an object count quota within a OpenShift Container Platform project, you can set defined limits on the number of objects, such as `BuildConfig` and `DeploymentConfig` objects.

</div>

When you use a resource quota, OpenShift Container Platform charges an object against the quota if the object exists in server storage. These quotas protect against exhaustion of storage resources.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  To configure an object count quota for a resource, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create quota <name> --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>,count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example showing object count quota

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create quota test --hard=count/deployments.extensions=2,count/replicasets.extensions=4,count/pods=3,count/secrets=4
    resourcequota "test" created
    ```

    </div>

2.  To inspect the detailed status of the object count quota, use the following `oc describe` command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc describe quota test
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    Name:                         test
    Namespace:                    quota
    Resource                      Used  Hard
    --------                      ----  ----
    count/deployments.extensions  0     2
    count/pods                    0     3
    count/replicasets.extensions  0     4
    count/secrets                 0     4
    ```

    </div>

    This example limits the listed resources to the hard limit in each project in the cluster.

## Configuring quota synchronization period

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

When a set of resources are deleted, the synchronization time frame of resources is determined by the `resource-quota-sync-period` setting in the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file. You can change the `resource-quota-sync-period` setting to have the set of resources regenerate in the needed amount of time (in seconds) for the resources to be once again available.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> Before quota usage is restored, you might encounter problems when attempting to reuse the resources.

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and determining resource usage when automation is used.

> [!NOTE]
> The `resource-quota-sync-period` setting balances system performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on the controller.

## Setting a quota to consume a resource

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To restrict the amount of a resource that a user can consume, set a quota. By doing this task, you can prevent unbounded usage of resources, such as storage classes, ensuring that project consumption remains within defined limits.

</div>

If a quota does not manage a resource, a user has no restriction on the amount of that resource that can be consumed. For example, if there is no quota on storage related to the gold storage class, the amount of gold storage a project can create is unbounded.

For high-cost compute or storage resources, administrators can require an explicit quota be granted to consume a resource. For example, if a project was not explicitly given quota for storage related to the gold storage class, users of that project would not be able to create any storage of that type.

The example in the procedure shows how the quota system intercepts every operation that creates or updates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource. The quota system checks what resources controlled by quota would be consumed. If there is no covering quota for those resources in the project, the request is denied. In this example, if a user creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource that uses storage associated with the gold storage class and there is no matching quota in the project, the request is denied.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- Add the following stanza to the `master-config.yaml` file. This stanza requires explicit quota to consume a particular resource.

  where:

  `configuration.resource`
  Specifies the group or resource whose consumption is limited by default.

  `configuration.matchContains`

# Limit ranges in a LimitRange object

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To define compute resource constraints at the object level, create a `LimitRange` object. By creating this object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that an individual pod, container, image, image stream, or persistent volume claim can consume.

</div>

All requests to create and modify resources are evaluated against each `LimitRange` object in the project. If the resource violates any of the enumerated constraints, the resource is rejected. If the resource does not set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, the default value is applied to the resource.

For CPU and memory limits, if you specify a maximum value but do not specify a minimum limit, the resource can consume more CPU and memory resources than the maximum value.

## Container limits

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that a container can consume.

</div>

The following list shows resources that a container can consume:

- CPU

- Memory

The following table shows the supported constraints for a container. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each container.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 27%" />
<col style="width: 72%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">Constraint</th>

<td style="text-align: left;"><p><code>Min[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> less than or equal to <code>container.resources.requests[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> (required) less than or equal to <code>container/resources.limits[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> (optional)</p>
<p>If the configuration defines a <code>min</code> CPU, the request value must be greater than the CPU value. If you do not set a <code>min</code> value or you set <code>min</code> to <code>0</code>, the result is no limit and the pod can consume more of the resource than the <code>max</code> value.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><code>Max</code></p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><code>container.resources.limits[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> (required) less than or equal to <code>Max[&lt;resource&gt;]</code></p>
<p>If the configuration defines a <code>max</code> CPU, you do not need to define a CPU request value. However, you must set a limit that satisfies the maximum CPU constraint that is specified in the limit range.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><code>MaxLimitRequestRatio</code></p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><code>MaxLimitRequestRatio[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> less than or equal to (<code>container.resources.limits[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> / <code>container.resources.requests[&lt;resource&gt;]</code>)</p>
<p>If the limit range defines a <code>maxLimitRequestRatio</code> constraint, any new containers must have both a <code>request</code> and a <code>limit</code> value. Additionally, OpenShift Container Platform calculates a limit-to-request ratio by dividing the <code>limit</code> by the <code>request</code>. The result should be an integer greater than 1.</p>
<p>For example, if a container has <code>cpu: 500</code> in the <code>limit</code> value, and <code>cpu: 100</code> in the <code>request</code> value, the limit-to-request ratio for <code>cpu</code> is <code>5</code>. This ratio must be less than or equal to the <code>maxLimitRequestRatio</code>.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The following list shows default resources that a container can consume:

- `Default[<resource>]`: Defaults `container.resources.limit[<resource>]` to specified value if none.

- `Default Requests[<resource>]`: Defaults `container.resources.requests[<resource>]` to specified value if none.

## Pod limits

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that a pod can consume.

</div>

A pod can consume the following resources:

- CPU

- Memory

The following table shows the supported constraints for a pod. Across all pods, the following behavior must hold true:

| Constraint | Enforced behavior |
|----|----|
| `Min` | `Min[<resource>]` less than or equal to `container.resources.requests[<resource>]` (required) less than or equal to `container.resources.limits[<resource>]`. If you do not set a `min` value or you set `min` to `0`, the result is no limit and the pod can consume more of the resource than the `max` value. |
| `Max` | `container.resources.limits[<resource>]` (required) less than or equal to `Max[<resource>]`. |
| `MaxLimitRequestRatio` | `MaxLimitRequestRatio[<resource>]` less than or equal to (`container.resources.limits[<resource>]` / `container.resources.requests[<resource>]`). |

## Image limits

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that an image can consume.

</div>

An image can consume the following resources:

- Storage

- `openshift.io/Image`

The following table shows the supported constraints for an image. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each image.

| Constraint | Behavior |
|----|----|
| `Max` | `image.dockerimagemetadata.size` less than or equal to `Max[<resource>]` |

Image limits

> [!NOTE]
> To prevent blobs that exceed the limit from being uploaded to the registry, you must configure the registry to enforce quota. The `REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA` environment variable must be set to `true`. By default, the environment variable is set to `true` for new deployments.

## Image stream limits

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that an image stream can consume.

</div>

An image stream can consume the following resources:

- `openshift.io/image-tags`

- `openshift.io/images`

- `openshift.io/ImageStream`

The `openshift.io/image-tags` resource represents unique stream limits. Possible references are an `ImageStreamTag`, an `ImageStreamImage`, or a `DockerImage`. You can use the `oc tag` and `oc import-image` commands or use image stream to create tags. No distinction exists between internal and external references. However, each unique reference that is tagged in an image stream specification is counted only once. The reference does not restrict pushes to an internal container image registry in any way, but the reference is useful for tag restriction.

The `openshift.io/images` resource represents unique image names that are recorded in image stream status. The resource helps restrict the number of images that can be pushed to the internal registry. Internal and external references are not distinguished.

The following table shows the supported constraints for an image stream. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each image stream.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 27%" />

## PersistentVolumeClaim limits

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that a `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource can consume.

</div>

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource can consume storage resources.

The following table shows the supported constraints for a persistent volume claim. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each persistent volume claim.
