# About bare metal hosts and nodes

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To provision a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) bare-metal host as a node in your cluster, first create a `MachineSet` custom resource (CR) object that corresponds to bare-metal host hardware.

</div>

Bare-metal host compute machine sets describe infrastructure components specific to your configuration. You apply specific Kubernetes labels to these compute machine sets and then update the infrastructure components to run on only those machines.

When you scale up the relevant `MachineSet` CR that contains a `metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts` annotation, `Machine` CRs are created automatically. OpenShift Container Platform uses `Machine` CRs to provision the bare-metal node that corresponds to the host as specified in the `MachineSet` CR.

# Maintaining bare metal hosts

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can maintain the details of the bare metal hosts in your cluster from the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  From the web console, comlete the following steps:

    1.  Navigate to **Compute** → **Bare Metal Hosts**.

    2.  Select a task from the **Actions** drop-down menu.

    3.  Manage items such as baseboard management controller (BMC) details, boot MAC address for the host, enable power management, and so on. You can also review the details of the network interfaces and drives for the host.

2.  Move a bare-metal host into maintenance mode. When you move a host into maintenance mode, the scheduler moves all managed workloads off the corresponding bare-metal node. No new workloads are scheduled while in maintenance mode.

3.  Deprovision a bare-metal host in the web console. Deprovisioning a host does the following actions:

    1.  Annotates the bare-metal host CR with `cluster.k8s.io/delete-machine: true`.

    2.  Scales down the related compute machine set.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Powering off the host without first moving the daemon set and unmanaged static pods to another node can cause service disruption and loss of data.

## Adding a bare-metal host to the cluster using YAML in the web console

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can add bare-metal hosts to the cluster in the web console by using a YAML file that describes the bare-metal host.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Install a RHCOS compute machine on bare-metal infrastructure for use in the cluster.

- Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

- Create a `Secret` CR for the bare-metal host.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  In the web console, navigate to **Compute** → **Bare Metal Hosts**.

2.  Select **Add Host** → **New from YAML**.

3.  Copy and paste the below YAML, modifying the relevant fields with the details of your host:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
    kind: BareMetalHost
    metadata:
      name: <bare_metal_host_name>
    spec:
      online: true
      bmc:
        address: <bmc_address>
        credentialsName: <secret_credentials_name>
        disableCertificateVerification: True
      bootMACAddress: <host_boot_mac_address>
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `spec.bmc.credentialsName`
    Specifies a reference to a valid `Secret` CR. The Bare Metal Operator cannot manage the bare-metal host without a valid `Secret` referenced in the `credentialsName`. For more information about secrets and how to create them, see "Understanding secrets".

    `spec.bmc.disableCertificateVerification`
    Specifies whether to require TLS host validation between the cluster and the baseboard management controller (BMC). When this field is set to `true`, TLS host validation is disabled.

4.  Select **Create** to save the YAML and create the new bare-metal host.

5.  Scale up the number of replicas to match the number of available bare-metal hosts. Navigate to **Compute** → **MachineSets**, and increase the number of machines in the cluster by selecting **Edit Machine count** from the **Actions** drop-down menu.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also manage the number of bare-metal nodes by using the `oc scale` command and the appropriate bare-metal compute machine set.

## Automatically scaling machines to the number of available bare-metal hosts

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To automatically create the number of `Machine` objects that matches the number of available `BareMetalHost` objects, add a `metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts` annotation to the `MachineSet` object.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Install RHCOS bare-metal compute machines for use in the cluster, and create corresponding `BareMetalHost` objects.

- Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

- Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  To configure automatic scaling for a compute machine set, annotate the compute machine set by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc annotate machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api 'metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts=<any_value>'
    ```

    - `<machineset>`: Specifies the name of the compute machine set that you want to configure for automatic scaling.

    - `<any_value>` Specifies is a value, such as `true` or `""`.

2.  Wait for the new scaled machines to start.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `BareMetalHost` object continues to be counted against the `MachineSet` that the `Machine` object was created from when the following conditions are met:
    >
    > - You use a `BareMetalHost` object to create a machine in the cluster.
    >
    > - You subsequently change labels or selectors on the `BareMetalHost`.

</div>

## Removing bare-metal hosts from the provisioner node

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

In certain circumstances, you might want to temporarily remove bare-metal hosts from the provisioner node. For example, to prevent the management of the number of `Machine` objects that matches the number of available `BareMetalHost` objects, add a `baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached` annotation to the `MachineSet` object.

</div>

Consider an example during provisioning when a bare-metal host reboot is triggered by using the OpenShift Container Platform administration console or as a result of a Machine Config Pool update. In this case, OpenShift Container Platform logs into the integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) and issues a delete of the job queue.

> [!NOTE]
> This annotation has an effect for only `BareMetalHost` objects that are in either `Provisioned`, `ExternallyProvisioned`, or `Ready/Available` states.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Install RHCOS bare-metal compute machines for use in the cluster and create corresponding `BareMetalHost` objects.

- Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

- Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  To configure automatic scaling for a compute machine set, annotate the compute machine set by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc annotate machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api 'baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached'
    ```

    Wait for the new machines to start.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you use a `BareMetalHost` object to create a machine in the cluster and labels or selectors are subsequently changed on the `BareMetalHost`, the `BareMetalHost` object continues to be counted against the `MachineSet` that the `Machine` object was created from.

2.  In the provisioning use case, remove the annotation after the reboot is complete by using the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc annotate machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api 'baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached-'
    ```
