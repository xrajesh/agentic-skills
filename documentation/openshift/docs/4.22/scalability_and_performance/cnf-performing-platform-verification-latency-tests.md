<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use the Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) tests image to run latency tests on a CNF-enabled OpenShift Container Platform cluster, where all the components required for running CNF workloads are installed. Run the latency tests to validate node tuning for your workload.

</div>

The `cnf-tests` container image is available at `registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.17`.

# Prerequisites for running latency tests

Your cluster must meet the following requirements before you can run the latency tests:

- You have applied all the required CNF configurations. This includes the `PerformanceProfile` cluster and other configuration according to the reference design specifications (RDS) or your specific requirements.

- You have logged in to `registry.redhat.io` with your Customer Portal credentials by using the `podman login` command.

# Measuring latency

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To accurately measure system latency, use the `hwlatdetect`, `cyclictest`, and `oslat` tools provided in the `cnf-tests` image. Evaluating these metrics helps you identify and resolve performance delays in your environment.

</div>

Each tool has a specific use. Use the tools in sequence to achieve reliable test results.

hwlatdetect
Measures the baseline that the bare-metal hardware can achieve. Before proceeding with the next latency test, ensure that the latency reported by `hwlatdetect` meets the required threshold because you cannot fix hardware latency spikes by operating system tuning.

cyclictest
Verifies the real-time kernel scheduler latency after `hwlatdetect` passes validation. The `cyclictest` tool schedules a repeated timer and measures the difference between the desired and the actual trigger times. The difference can uncover basic issues with the tuning caused by interrupts or process priorities. The tool must run on a real-time kernel.

oslat
Behaves similarly to a CPU-intensive DPDK application and measures all the interruptions and disruptions to the busy loop that simulates CPU heavy data processing.

The tests introduce the following environment variables:

# Running the latency tests

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Run the cluster latency tests to validate node tuning for your Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) workload.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. Depending on your local operating system and SELinux configuration, you might also experience issues running these commands from your home directory. To make the `podman` commands work, run the commands from a folder that is not your home/\<username\> directory, and append `:Z` to the volumes creation. For example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.

The procedure runs the three individual tests `hwlatdetect`, `cyclictest`, and `oslat`. For details on these individual tests, see their individual sections.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Open a shell prompt in the directory containing the `kubeconfig` file.

    You provide the test image with a `kubeconfig` file in current directory and its related `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable, mounted through a volume. This allows the running container to use the `kubeconfig` file from inside the container.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the following command, your local `kubeconfig` is mounted to kubeconfig/kubeconfig in the cnf-tests container, which allows access to the cluster.

2.  To run the latency tests, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:

    ``` terminal
    $ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
    -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600\
    -e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
    registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.17 /usr/bin/test-run.sh \
    --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
    ```

    The LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME is shown in seconds, in this case 600 seconds (10 minutes). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than MAXIMUM_LATENCY (20 μs).

    If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.

3.  Optional: Append `--ginkgo.dry-run` flag to run the latency tests in dry-run mode. This is useful for checking what commands the tests run.

4.  Optional: Append `--ginkgo.v` flag to run the tests with increased verbosity.

5.  Optional: Append `--ginkgo.timeout="24h"` flag to ensure the Ginkgo 2.0 test suite does not timeout before the latency tests complete.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > During testing shorter time periods, as shown, can be used to run the tests. However, for final verification and valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours (43200 seconds).

- The duration of the test

- The number of CPU cores

- The host firmware settings

## Running oslat

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To evaluate how your cluster handles CPU-heavy data processing, run the `oslat` test. This diagnostic tool simulates a CPU-intensive DPDK application to measure system interruptions and performance disruptions.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. Depending on your local operating system and SELinux configuration, you might also experience issues running these commands from your home directory. To make the `podman` commands work, run the commands from a folder that is not your home/\<username\> directory, and append `:Z` to the volumes creation. For example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have reviewed the prerequisites for running latency tests.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To perform the `oslat` test, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:

  ``` terminal
  $ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
  -e LATENCY_TEST_CPUS=10 -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600 -e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
  registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.17 \
  /usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.focus="oslat" --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
  ```

  `LATENCY_TEST_CPUS` specifies the number of CPUs to test with the `oslat` command.

  The command runs the `oslat` tool for 10 minutes (600 seconds). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than `MAXIMUM_LATENCY` (20 μs).

  If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > During testing shorter time periods, as shown, can be used to run the tests. However, for final verification and valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours (43200 seconds).

# Running latency tests in a disconnected cluster

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

The CNF tests image can run tests in a disconnected cluster that is not able to reach external registries. This requires two steps:

</div>

1.  Mirroring the `cnf-tests` image to the custom disconnected registry.

2.  Instructing the tests to consume the images from the custom disconnected registry.

## Mirroring the images to a custom registry accessible from the cluster

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To make required images accessible from your cluster, mirror them to a custom registry. Performing this synchronization ensures that your deployment has the necessary container files, which is particularly useful in restricted or disconnected network environments.

</div>

A `mirror` executable is shipped in the image to provide the input required by `oc` to mirror the test image to a local registry.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Run the following command from an intermediate machine that has access to the cluster and registry.redhat.io:

    ``` terminal
    $ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
    registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.17 \
    /usr/bin/mirror -registry <disconnected_registry> | oc image mirror -f -
    ```

    where:

    `<disconnected_registry>`
    Specifies the disconnected mirror registry you have configured, such as `my.local.registry:5000/`.

2.  When you have mirrored the `cnf-tests` image into the disconnected registry, you must override the original registry used to fetch the images when running the tests by a command similar to the following example:

    ``` terminal
    $ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
    -e IMAGE_REGISTRY="<disconnected_registry>" \
    -e CNF_TESTS_IMAGE="cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.17" \
    -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds> \
    <disconnected_registry>/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.17 /usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
    ```

</div>

## Configuring the tests to consume images from a custom registry

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can run the latency tests by using a custom test image and image registry using `CNF_TESTS_IMAGE` and `IMAGE_REGISTRY` variables.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To configure the latency tests to use a custom test image and image registry, run a command similar to the following example:

  ``` terminal
  $ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
  -e IMAGE_REGISTRY="<custom_image_registry>" \
  -e CNF_TESTS_IMAGE="<custom_cnf-tests_image>" \
  -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds> \
  registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.17 /usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
  ```

  where:

  `<custom_image_registry>`
  Specifies the custom image registry, for example, `custom.registry:5000/`.

  `<custom_cnf-tests_image>`
  Specifies the custom cnf-tests image, for example, `custom-cnf-tests-image:latest`.

</div>

## Mirroring images to the cluster OpenShift image registry

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To make container images locally available for your deployment, mirror them to the built-in OpenShift image registry. This integrated component runs as a standard workload on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster to ensure continuous access to required files.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Gain external access to the registry by exposing the registry with a route. You can do this task by running a command similar to the following example:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge
    ```

2.  Fetch the registry endpoint by running a command similar to the following example:

    ``` terminal
    $ REGISTRY=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
    ```

3.  Create a namespace for exposing the images by running a command similar to the following example:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create ns cnftests
    ```

4.  Make the image stream available to all the namespaces used for tests. This is required to allow the tests namespaces to fetch the images from the `cnf-tests` image stream. Run commands similar to the following examples:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:cnf-features-testing:default --namespace=cnftests
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:performance-addon-operators-testing:default --namespace=cnftests
    ```

5.  Retrieve the docker secret name by running a command similar to the following example:

    ``` terminal
    $ SECRET=$(oc -n cnftests get secret | grep builder-docker | awk {'print $1'}
    ```

6.  Retrieve the docker auth token by running a command similar to the following example:

    ``` terminal
    $ TOKEN=$(oc -n cnftests get secret $SECRET -o jsonpath="{.data['\.dockercfg']}" | base64 --decode | jq '.["image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000"].auth')
    ```

7.  Create a `dockerauth.json` file, for example:

    ``` bash
    $ echo "{\"auths\": { \"$REGISTRY\": { \"auth\": $TOKEN } }}" > dockerauth.json
    ```

8.  Mirror the image by running a command similar to the following example:

    ``` terminal
    $ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
    registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.17 \
    /usr/bin/mirror -registry $REGISTRY/cnftests |  oc image mirror --insecure=true \
    -a=$(pwd)/dockerauth.json -f -
    ```

9.  Run the tests by running a command similar to the following example:

    ``` terminal
    $ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
    -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds> \
    -e IMAGE_REGISTRY=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/cnftests cnf-tests-local:latest /usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
    ```

</div>

## Mirroring a different set of test images

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can optionally change the default upstream images that are mirrored for the latency tests.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  The `mirror` command tries to mirror the upstream images by default. This can be overridden by passing a file with the following format to the image:

    ``` yaml
    [
        {
            "registry": "public.registry.io:5000",
            "image": "imageforcnftests:4.17"
        }
    ]
    ```

2.  Pass the file to the `mirror` command, for example saving it locally as `images.json`. With the following command, the local path is mounted in `/kubeconfig` inside the container and that can be passed to the mirror command.

    ``` terminal
    $ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
    registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.17 /usr/bin/mirror \
    --registry "my.local.registry:5000/" --images "/kubeconfig/images.json" \
    |  oc image mirror -f -
    ```

</div>

# Troubleshooting errors with the cnf-tests container
