# Recommended firmware configuration for vDU cluster hosts

Use the following table as the basis to configure the cluster host firmware for vDU applications running on OpenShift Container Platform 4.17.

> [!NOTE]
> The following table is a general recommendation for vDU cluster host firmware configuration. Exact firmware settings will depend on your requirements and specific hardware platform. Automatic setting of firmware is not handled by the zero touch provisioning pipeline.

| Firmware setting | Configuration | Description |
|----|----|----|
| HyperTransport (HT) | Enabled | HyperTransport (HT) bus is a bus technology developed by AMD. HT provides a high-speed link between the components in the host memory and other system peripherals. |
| UEFI | Enabled | Enable booting from UEFI for the vDU host. |
| CPU Power and Performance Policy | Performance | Set CPU Power and Performance Policy to optimize the system for performance over energy efficiency. |
| Uncore Frequency Scaling | Disabled | Disable Uncore Frequency Scaling to prevent the voltage and frequency of non-core parts of the CPU from being set independently. |
| Uncore Frequency | Maximum | Sets the non-core parts of the CPU such as cache and memory controller to their maximum possible frequency of operation. |
| Performance P-limit | Disabled | Disable Performance P-limit to prevent the Uncore frequency coordination of processors. |
| Enhanced Intel® SpeedStep Tech | Enabled | Enable Enhanced Intel SpeedStep to allow the system to dynamically adjust processor voltage and core frequency that decreases power consumption and heat production in the host. |
| Intel® Turbo Boost Technology | Enabled | Enable Turbo Boost Technology for Intel-based CPUs to automatically allow processor cores to run faster than the rated operating frequency if they are operating below power, current, and temperature specification limits. |
| Intel Configurable TDP | Enabled | Enables Thermal Design Power (TDP) for the CPU. |
| Configurable TDP Level | Level 2 | TDP level sets the CPU power consumption required for a particular performance rating. TDP level 2 sets the CPU to the most stable performance level at the cost of power consumption. |
| Energy Efficient Turbo | Disabled | Disable Energy Efficient Turbo to prevent the processor from using an energy-efficiency based policy. |
| Hardware P-States | Enabled or Disabled | Enable OS-controlled P-States to allow power saving configurations. Disable `P-states` (performance states) to optimize the operating system and CPU for performance over power consumption. |
| Package C-State | C0/C1 state | Use C0 or C1 states to set the processor to a fully active state (C0) or to stop CPU internal clocks running in software (C1). |
| C1E | Disabled | CPU Enhanced Halt (C1E) is a power saving feature in Intel chips. Disabling C1E prevents the operating system from sending a halt command to the CPU when inactive. |
| Processor C6 | Disabled | C6 power-saving is a CPU feature that automatically disables idle CPU cores and cache. Disabling C6 improves system performance. |
| Sub-NUMA Clustering | Disabled | Sub-NUMA clustering divides the processor cores, cache, and memory into multiple NUMA domains. Disabling this option can increase performance for latency-sensitive workloads. |

Recommended cluster host firmware settings

> [!NOTE]
> Enable global SR-IOV and VT-d settings in the firmware for the host. These settings are relevant to bare-metal environments.

> [!NOTE]
> Enable both `C-states` and OS-controlled `P-States` to allow per pod power management.

# Recommended cluster configurations to run vDU applications

Clusters running virtualized distributed unit (vDU) applications require a highly tuned and optimized configuration. The following information describes the various elements that you require to support vDU workloads in OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 clusters.

## Recommended cluster MachineConfig CRs for single-node OpenShift clusters

Check that the `MachineConfig` custom resources (CRs) that you extract from the `ztp-site-generate` container are applied in the cluster. The CRs can be found in the extracted `out/source-crs/extra-manifest/` folder.

The following `MachineConfig` CRs from the `ztp-site-generate` container configure the cluster host:

## Recommended cluster Operators

The following Operators are required for clusters running virtualized distributed unit (vDU) applications and are a part of the baseline reference configuration:

- Node Tuning Operator (NTO). NTO packages functionality that was previously delivered with the Performance Addon Operator, which is now a part of NTO.

- PTP Operator

- SR-IOV Network Operator

- Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator

- Local Storage Operator

## Recommended cluster kernel configuration

Always use the latest supported real-time kernel version in your cluster. Ensure that you apply the following configurations in the cluster:

1.  Ensure that the following `additionalKernelArgs` are set in the cluster performance profile:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
    kind: PerformanceProfile
    # ...
    spec:
      additionalKernelArgs:
      - "rcupdate.rcu_normal_after_boot=0"
      - "efi=runtime"
      - "vfio_pci.enable_sriov=1"
      - "vfio_pci.disable_idle_d3=1"
      - "module_blacklist=irdma"

      # ...
    ```

2.  Optional: Set the CPU frequency under the `hardwareTuning` field:

    You can use hardware tuning to tune CPU frequencies for reserved and isolated core CPUs. For FlexRAN like applications, hardware vendors recommend that you run CPU frequencies below the default provided frequencies. It is highly recommended that, before setting any frequencies, you refer to the hardware vendor’s guidelines for maximum frequency settings for your processor generation. This example sets the frequencies for reserved and isolated CPUs to 2500 MHz:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
    kind: PerformanceProfile
    metadata:
      name: openshift-node-performance-profile
    spec:
          cpu:
            isolated: "2-19,22-39"
            reserved: "0-1,20-21"
          hugepages:
            defaultHugepagesSize: 1G
            pages:
              - size: 1G
                count: 32
          realTimeKernel:
              enabled: true
          hardwareTuning:
              isolatedCpuFreq: 2500000
              reservedCpuFreq: 2500000
    ```

3.  Ensure that the `performance-patch` profile in the `Tuned` CR configures the correct CPU isolation set that matches the `isolated` CPU set in the related `PerformanceProfile` CR, for example:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Tuned
    metadata:
      name: performance-patch
      namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
      annotations:
        ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave: "10"
    spec:
      profile:
        - name: performance-patch
          # The 'include' line must match the associated PerformanceProfile name, for example:
          # include=openshift-node-performance-${PerformanceProfile.metadata.name}
          # When using the standard (non-realtime) kernel, remove the kernel.timer_migration override from the [sysctl] section
          data: |
            [main]
            summary=Configuration changes profile inherited from performance created tuned
            include=openshift-node-performance-openshift-node-performance-profile
            [scheduler]
            group.ice-ptp=0:f:10:*:ice-ptp.*
            group.ice-gnss=0:f:10:*:ice-gnss.*
            group.ice-dplls=0:f:10:*:ice-dplls.*
            [service]
            service.stalld=start,enable
            service.chronyd=stop,disable
    # ...
    ```

## Checking the realtime kernel version

Always use the latest version of the realtime kernel in your OpenShift Container Platform clusters. If you are unsure about the kernel version that is in use in the cluster, you can compare the current realtime kernel version to the release version with the following procedure.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

- You are logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

- You have installed `podman`.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Run the following command to get the cluster version:

    ``` terminal
    $ OCP_VERSION=$(oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.status.desired.version}{"\n"}')
    ```

2.  Get the release image SHA number:

    ``` terminal
    $ DTK_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for=driver-toolkit quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:$OCP_VERSION-x86_64)
    ```

3.  Run the release image container and extract the kernel version that is packaged with cluster’s current release:

    ``` terminal
    $ podman run --rm $DTK_IMAGE rpm -qa | grep 'kernel-rt-core-' | sed 's#kernel-rt-core-##'
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    4.18.0-305.49.1.rt7.121.el8_4.x86_64
    ```

    </div>

    This is the default realtime kernel version that ships with the release.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The realtime kernel is denoted by the string `.rt` in the kernel version.

</div>

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

Check that the kernel version listed for the cluster’s current release matches actual realtime kernel that is running in the cluster. Run the following commands to check the running realtime kernel version:

</div>

1.  Open a remote shell connection to the cluster node:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc debug node/<node_name>
    ```

2.  Check the realtime kernel version:

    ``` terminal
    sh-4.4# uname -r
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    4.18.0-305.49.1.rt7.121.el8_4.x86_64
    ```

    </div>

# Checking that the recommended cluster configurations are applied

You can check that clusters are running the correct configuration. The following procedure describes how to check the various configurations that you require to deploy a DU application in OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 clusters.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have deployed a cluster and tuned it for vDU workloads.

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

- You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Check that the default OperatorHub sources are disabled. Run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get operatorhub cluster -o yaml
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    spec:
        disableAllDefaultSources: true
    ```

    </div>

2.  Check that all required `CatalogSource` resources are annotated for workload partitioning (`PreferredDuringScheduling`) by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get catalogsource -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{" -- "}{.metadata.annotations.target\.workload\.openshift\.io/management}{"\n"}{end}'
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    certified-operators -- {"effect": "PreferredDuringScheduling"}
    community-operators -- {"effect": "PreferredDuringScheduling"}
    ran-operators
    redhat-marketplace -- {"effect": "PreferredDuringScheduling"}
    redhat-operators -- {"effect": "PreferredDuringScheduling"}
    ```

    </div>

    - `CatalogSource` resources that are not annotated are also returned. In this example, the `ran-operators` `CatalogSource` resource is not annotated and does not have the `PreferredDuringScheduling` annotation.

      > [!NOTE]
      > In a properly configured vDU cluster, only a single annotated catalog source is listed.

3.  Check that all applicable OpenShift Container Platform Operator namespaces are annotated for workload partitioning. This includes all Operators installed with core OpenShift Container Platform and the set of additional Operators included in the reference DU tuning configuration. Run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get namespaces -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{" -- "}{.metadata.annotations.workload\.openshift\.io/allowed}{"\n"}{end}'
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    default --
    openshift-apiserver -- management
    openshift-apiserver-operator -- management
    openshift-authentication -- management
    openshift-authentication-operator -- management
    ```

    </div>

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Additional Operators must not be annotated for workload partitioning. In the output from the previous command, additional Operators should be listed without any value on the right side of the `--` separator.

4.  Check that the `ClusterLogging` configuration is correct. Run the following commands:

    1.  Validate that the appropriate input and output logs are configured:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get -n openshift-logging ClusterLogForwarder instance -o yaml
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

        - `master_offset` should be between -100 and 100 ns.

        - Indicates that the PTP clock is synchronized to a master, and the local clock is not the grandmaster clock.

    4.  Check that the expected `master offset` value corresponding to the value in `/var/run/ptp4l.0.config` is found in the `linuxptp-daemon-container` log:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc logs $PTP_POD_NAME -n openshift-ptp -c linuxptp-daemon-container
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

8.  Check that the SR-IOV configuration is correct by running the following commands:

    1.  Check that the `disableDrain` value in the `SriovOperatorConfig` resource is set to `true`:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get sriovoperatorconfig -n openshift-sriov-network-operator default -o jsonpath="{.spec.disableDrain}{'\n'}"
        ```

        Example output

        </div>

        ``` terminal
        true
        ```

        </div>

    2.  Check that the `SriovNetworkNodeState` sync status is `Succeeded` by running the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get SriovNetworkNodeStates -n openshift-sriov-network-operator -o jsonpath="{.items[*].status.syncStatus}{'\n'}"
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        </div>

        ``` terminal
        Succeeded
        ```

        </div>

    3.  Verify that the expected number and configuration of virtual functions (`Vfs`) under each interface configured for SR-IOV is present and correct in the `.status.interfaces` field. For example:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get SriovNetworkNodeStates -n openshift-sriov-network-operator -o yaml
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">
