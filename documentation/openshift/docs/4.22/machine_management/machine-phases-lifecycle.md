Machines move through a *lifecycle* that has several defined phases. Understanding the machine lifecycle and its phases can help you verify whether a procedure is complete or troubleshoot undesired behavior. In OpenShift Container Platform, the machine lifecycle is consistent across all supported cloud providers.

# Machine phases

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Understanding machine lifecycle phases can help you troubleshoot machine issues. As a machine moves through its lifecycle, it passes through different phases. Each phase is a basic representation of the state of the machine.

</div>

`Provisioning`
There is a request to provision a new machine. The machine does not yet exist and does not have an instance, a provider ID, or an address.

`Provisioned`
The machine exists and has a provider ID or an address. The cloud provider has created an instance for the machine. The machine has not yet become a node and the `status.nodeRef` section of the machine object is not yet populated.

`Running`
The machine exists and has a provider ID or address. Ignition has run successfully and the cluster machine approver has approved a certificate signing request (CSR). The machine has become a node and the `status.nodeRef` section of the machine object contains node details.

`Deleting`
There is a request to delete the machine. The machine object has a `DeletionTimestamp` field that indicates the time of the deletion request.

`Failed`
There is an unrecoverable problem with the machine. This can happen, for example, if the cloud provider deletes the instance for the machine.

# The machine lifecycle

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Understanding the machine lifecycle can help you troubleshoot machine issues. The lifecycle begins with the request to provision a machine and continues until the machine no longer exists.

</div>

The machine lifecycle proceeds in the following order. Interruptions due to errors or lifecycle hooks are not included in this overview.

1.  There is a request to provision a new machine for one of the following reasons:

    - A cluster administrator scales a machine set such that it requires additional machines.

    - An autoscaling policy scales machine set such that it requires additional machines.

    - A machine that is managed by a machine set fails or is deleted and the machine set creates a replacement to maintain the required number of machines.

2.  The machine enters the `Provisioning` phase.

3.  The infrastructure provider creates an instance for the machine.

4.  The machine has a provider ID or address and enters the `Provisioned` phase.

5.  The Ignition configuration file is processed.

6.  The kubelet issues a certificate signing request (CSR).

7.  The cluster machine approver approves the CSR.

8.  The machine becomes a node and enters the `Running` phase.

9.  An existing machine is slated for deletion for one of the following reasons:

    - A user with `cluster-admin` permissions uses the `oc delete machine` command.

    - The machine gets a `machine.openshift.io/delete-machine` annotation.

    - The machine set that manages the machine marks it for deletion to reduce the replica count as part of reconciliation.

    - The cluster autoscaler identifies a node that is unnecessary to meet the deployment needs of the cluster.

    - A machine health check is configured to replace an unhealthy machine.

10. The machine enters the `Deleting` phase, in which it is marked for deletion but is still present in the API.

11. The machine controller removes the instance from the infrastructure provider.

12. The machine controller deletes the `Node` object.

# Determining the phase of a machine by using the CLI

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To troubleshoot issues with a machine, you can find the phase of a machine by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- List the machines on the cluster by running the following command:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
  ```

  <div class="formalpara">

  <div class="title">

  Example output

  </div>

  ``` text
  NAME                                      PHASE     TYPE         REGION      ZONE         AGE
  mycluster-5kbsp-master-0                  Running   m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   4h55m
  mycluster-5kbsp-master-1                  Running   m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1b   4h55m
  mycluster-5kbsp-master-2                  Running   m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   4h55m
  mycluster-5kbsp-worker-us-west-1a-fmx8t   Running   m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   4h51m
  mycluster-5kbsp-worker-us-west-1a-m889l   Running   m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   4h51m
  mycluster-5kbsp-worker-us-west-1b-c8qzm   Running   m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1b   4h51m
  ```

  </div>

  The `PHASE` column of the output contains the phase of each machine.

# Determining the phase of a machine by using the web console

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To troubleshoot issues with a machine, you can find the phase of a machine by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Log in to the web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

2.  Navigate to **Compute** → **Machines**.

3.  On the **Machines** page, select the name of the machine that you want to find the phase of.

4.  On the **Machine details** page, select the **YAML** tab.

5.  In the YAML block, find the value of the `status.phase` field.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example YAML snippet

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
    kind: Machine
    metadata:
      name: mycluster-5kbsp-worker-us-west-1a-fmx8t
    # ...
    status:
      phase: Running
    ```

    </div>

    In this example, the phase is `Running`.
