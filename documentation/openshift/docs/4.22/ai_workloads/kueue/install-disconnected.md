Before you can install Red Hat build of Kueue on a disconnected OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you must enable Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in disconnected environments by completing the following steps:

- Disable the default remote OperatorHub sources for OLM.

- Use a workstation with full internet access to create and push local mirrors of the OperatorHub content to a mirror registry.

- Configure OLM to install and manage Operators from local sources on the mirror registry instead of the default remote sources.

After enabling OLM in a disconnected environment, you can continue to use your unrestricted workstation to keep your local OperatorHub sources updated as newer versions of Operators are released.

For full documentation on completing these steps, see the OpenShift Container Platform documentation on [Using Operator Lifecycle Manager in disconnected environments](../../disconnected/using-olm.xml#olm-restricted-networks).

# Installing the Red Hat Build of Kueue Operator

You can install the Red Hat Build of Kueue Operator on a OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using the OperatorHub in the web console.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have administrator permissions on a OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

- You have access to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

- You have installed and configured the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift for your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click **Operators** → **OperatorHub**.

2.  Choose **Red Hat Build of Kueue Operator** from the list of available Operators, and click **Install**.

3.  Select **Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace**.

    This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the Namespace object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the `openshift-kueue-operator` namespace.

4.  Click **Install**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Alternatively, if you are creating the `Namespace` object by using YAML, ensure that you include the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label:
    >
    > \+
    >
    > ``` yaml
    > apiVersion: v1
    > kind: Namespace
    > metadata:

# Creating a Kueue custom resource

After you have installed the Red Hat Build of Kueue Operator, you must create a `Kueue` custom resource (CR) to configure your installation.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

Ensure that you have completed the following prerequisites:

</div>

- The Red Hat build of Kueue Operator is installed on your cluster.

- You have cluster administrator permissions and the `kueue-batch-admin-role` role.

- You have access to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click **Operators** → **Installed Operators**.

2.  In the **Provided APIs** table column, click **Kueue**. This takes you to the **Kueue** tab of the **Operator details** page.

3.  Click **Create Kueue**. This takes you to the **Create Kueue** YAML view.

4.  Enter the details for your `Kueue` CR.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example `Kueue` CR

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: kueue.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Kueue
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: kueue-operator
        app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize

        preemption:
          preemptionPolicy: Classical
    # ...
    ```

    </div>

    - The name of the `Kueue` CR must be `cluster`.

    - If you want to configure Red Hat build of Kueue for use with other workload types, add those types here. The default configuration is `BatchJob`. Additional types are `Pod`, `Deployment`, and `StatefulSet`.

    - Optional: If you want to configure fair sharing for Red Hat build of Kueue, set the `preemptionPolicy` value to `FairSharing`. The default setting in the `Kueue` CR is `Classical` preemption.

5.  Click **Create**.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

- After you create the `Kueue` CR, the web console brings you to the **Operator details** page, where you can see the CR in the list of **Kueues**.

- Optional: If you have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed, you can run the following command and observe the output to confirm that your `Kueue` CR has been created successfully:

  ``` terminal

# Labeling namespaces to allow Red Hat build of Kueue to manage jobs

The Red Hat build of Kueue Operator uses an opt-in webhook mechanism to ensure that policies are only enforced for the jobs and namespaces that it is expected to target.

You must label the namespaces where you want Red Hat build of Kueue to manage jobs with the `kueue.openshift.io/managed=true` label.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have cluster administrator permissions.

- The Red Hat build of Kueue Operator is installed on your cluster, and you have created a `Kueue` custom resource (CR).

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- Add the `kueue.openshift.io/managed=true` label to a namespace by running the following command:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc label namespace <namespace> kueue.openshift.io/managed=true
  ```

</div>

When you add this label, you instruct the Red Hat build of Kueue Operator that the namespace is managed by its webhook admission controllers. As a result, any Red Hat build of Kueue resources within that namespace are properly validated and mutated.
