# Collecting data for Red Hat Support

You can use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command to collect the information about your Red Hat build of Kueue instance that is most likely needed for debugging issues, including:

- Red Hat build of Kueue custom resources, such as workloads, cluster queues, local queues, resource flavors, admission checks, and their corresponding cluster resource definitions (CRDs)

- Services

- Endpoints

- Webhook configurations

- Logs from the `openshift-kueue-operator` namespace and `kueue-controller-manager` pods

Collected data is written into a new directory named `must-gather/` in the current working directory by default.

Procedure

</div>

1.  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

2.  Collect `must-gather` data by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc adm must-gather \
      --image=registry.redhat.io/kueue/kueue-must-gather-rhel9:<version>
    ```

    Where `<version>` is your current version of Red Hat build of Kueue.

3.  Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was just created in your working directory. Make sure you provide the date and cluster ID for the unique `must-gather` data. For more information about how to find the cluster ID, see [How to find the cluster-id or name on OpenShift cluster](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5280291).

4.  Attach the compressed file to your support case on the [the **Customer Support** page](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/list) of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
