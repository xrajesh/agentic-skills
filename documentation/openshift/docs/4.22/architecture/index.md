OpenShift Container Platform is a cloud-based Kubernetes container platform. The foundation of OpenShift Container Platform is based on Kubernetes and therefore shares the same technology. To learn more about OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes, see [product architecture](../architecture/architecture.xml#architecture).

# Glossary of common terms for OpenShift Container Platform architecture

This glossary defines common terms that are used in the architecture content.

access policies
A set of roles that dictate how users, applications, and entities within a cluster interact with one another. An access policy increases cluster security.

admission plugins
Admission plugins enforce security policies, resource limitations, or configuration requirements.

authentication
To control access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, a cluster administrator can configure user authentication to ensure only approved users access the cluster. To interact with an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you must authenticate with the OpenShift Container Platform API. You can authenticate by providing an OAuth access token or an X.509 client certificate in your requests to the OpenShift Container Platform API.

bootstrap
A temporary machine that runs minimal Kubernetes and deploys the OpenShift Container Platform control plane.

certificate signing requests (CSRs)
A resource requests a denoted signer to sign a certificate. This request might get approved or denied.

Cluster Version Operator (CVO)
An Operator that checks with the OpenShift Container Platform Update Service to see the valid updates and update paths based on current component versions and information in the graph.

compute nodes
Nodes that are responsible for executing workloads for cluster users. Compute nodes are also known as worker nodes.

configuration drift
A situation where the configuration on a node does not match what the machine config specifies.

containers
Lightweight and executable images that consist of software and all of its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers anywhere, such as data centers, public or private clouds, and local hosts.

# About installation and updates

As a cluster administrator, you can use the OpenShift Container Platform [installation program](../architecture/architecture-installation.xml#architecture-installation) to install and deploy a cluster by using one of the following methods:

- Installer-provisioned infrastructure

- User-provisioned infrastructure

# About the control plane

The [control plane](../architecture/control-plane.xml#control-plane) manages the worker nodes and the pods in your cluster. You can configure nodes with the use of machine config pools (MCPs). MCPs are groups of machines, such as control plane components or user workloads, that are based on the resources that they handle. OpenShift Container Platform assigns different roles to hosts. These roles define the function of a machine in a cluster. The cluster contains definitions for the standard control plane and worker role types.

You can use Operators to package, deploy, and manage services on the control plane. Operators are important components in OpenShift Container Platform because they provide the following services:

- Perform health checks

- Provide ways to watch applications

- Manage over-the-air updates

- Ensure applications stay in the specified state

# About containerized applications for developers

As a developer, you can use different tools, methods, and formats to [develop your containerized application](../architecture/understanding-development.xml#understanding-development) based on your unique requirements, for example:

- Use various build-tool, base-image, and registry options to build a simple container application.

- Use supporting components such as the software catalog and templates to develop your application.

- Package and deploy your application as an Operator.

You can also create a Kubernetes manifest and store it in a Git repository. Kubernetes works on basic units called pods. A pod is a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods can contain one or more containers. You can create a service by grouping a set of pods and their access policies. Services provide permanent internal IP addresses and host names for other applications to use as pods are created and destroyed. Kubernetes defines workloads based on the type of your application.

# About Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) and Ignition

As a cluster administrator, you can perform the following Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) tasks:

- Learn about the next generation of [single-purpose container operating system technology](../architecture/architecture-rhcos.xml#architecture-rhcos).

- Choose how to configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)

- Choose how to deploy Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS):

  - Installer-provisioned deployment

  - User-provisioned deployment

The OpenShift Container Platform installation program creates the Ignition configuration files that you need to deploy your cluster. Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) uses Ignition during the initial configuration to perform common disk tasks, such as partitioning, formatting, writing files, and configuring users. During the first boot, Ignition reads its configuration from the installation media or the location that you specify and applies the configuration to the machines.

You can learn how [Ignition works](../architecture/architecture-rhcos.xml#architecture-rhcos), the process for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machine in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, view Ignition configuration files, and change Ignition configuration after an installation.

# About admission plugins

You can use [admission plugins](../architecture/admission-plug-ins.xml#admission-plug-ins) to regulate how OpenShift Container Platform functions. After a resource request is authenticated and authorized, admission plugins intercept the resource request to the master API to validate resource requests and to ensure that scaling policies are adhered to. Admission plugins are used to enforce security policies, resource limitations, configuration requirements, and other settings.

# About Linux cgroup version 2

OpenShift Container Platform uses [Linux control group version 2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html) (cgroup v2) in your cluster.

cgroup v2 offers several improvements over cgroup v1, including a unified hierarchy, safer sub-tree delegation, features such as [Pressure Stall Information](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html), and enhanced resource management and isolation. However, cgroup v2 has different CPU, memory, and I/O management characteristics than cgroup v1. Therefore, some workloads might experience slight differences in memory or CPU usage on clusters that run cgroup v2.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you run third-party monitoring and security agents that depend on the cgroup file system, update the agents to a version that supports cgroup v2.
>
> - If you have configured cgroup v2 and run cAdvisor as a stand-alone daemon set for monitoring pods and containers, update cAdvisor to v0.43.0 or later.
>
> - If you deploy Java applications, use versions that fully support cgroup v2, such as the following packages:
>
>   - OpenJDK / HotSpot: jdk8u372, 11.0.16, 15 and later
>
>   - NodeJs 20.3.0 and later
>
>   - IBM Semeru Runtimes: jdk8u345-b01, 11.0.16.0, 17.0.4.0, 18.0.2.0 and later
>
>   - IBM SDK Java Technology Edition Version (IBM Java): 8.0.7.15 and later
