You can use the vSphere Problem Detector Operator to check a cluster that you deployed on VMware vSphere for common installation and misconfiguration issues that relate to storage.

# About the vSphere Problem Detector Operator

The vSphere Problem Detector Operator checks a cluster that you deployed on VMware vSphere for common installation and configuration issues that relate to storage.

After the Cluster Storage Operator starts and determines that a cluster runs on VMware vSphere, the Cluster Storage Operator launches the vSphere Problem Detector Operator. When the vSphere Problem Detector Operator starts, the Operator immediately runs the checks. The vSphere Problem Detector Operator communicates with the vSphere vCenter Server to find the virtual machines in the cluster, the default datastore, and other information about the vSphere vCenter Server configuration. The Operator uses the credentials from the Cloud Credential Operator to connect to vSphere.

The Operator runs the checks according to the following schedule:

- The checks run every hour.

- If any check fails, the Operator runs the checks again in intervals of 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4, 8, and so on. The Operator doubles the interval up to a maximum interval of 8 hours.

- When all checks pass, the schedule returns to an hour interval.

After a failure, the Operator increases its check frequency to quickly report success when the failure condition gets resolved. You can run the Operator manually for immediate troubleshooting information.

# Running the vSphere Problem Detector Operator checks

You can override the schedule for running the vSphere Problem Detector Operator checks and run the checks immediately.

The vSphere Problem Detector Operator automatically runs the checks every hour. After the Operator starts, the Operator runs the checks immediately. After the Cluster Storage Operator starts and determines that a cluster runs on VMware vSphere, the Cluster Storage Operator starts the vSphere Problem Detector Operator. To run the checks immediately, you can scale the vSphere Problem Detector Operator to `0` and back to `1` so that the Cluster Storage Operator restarts the vSphere Problem Detector Operator.

# Viewing the logs from the vSphere Problem Detector Operator

After the vSphere Problem Detector Operator runs and performs the configuration checks, the Operator creates log records that you can view from the command-line interface (CLI) or from the OpenShift Container Platform web console. Log lines that indicate `passed` means that you do not need to perform any actions.

The ideal output for a log line indicates `passed` or `0 problems`. If a log line indicates `failure` or 1 or more problems, see the information in the "Configuration checks run by the vSphere Problem Detector Operator" document.

# About the storage class configuration check

The datastore name and cluster ID relate to the names for persistent volumes that use VMware vSphere storage. After the creation of a persistent volume, `systemd` creates a mount unit for the persistent volume.

The `systemd` process has a 255 character limit for the length of the fully qualified path to the virtual machine disk (VMDK) file. This path follows the naming conventions for `systemd` and vSphere. The naming conventions use the following example pattern:

``` text
/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume/mounts/[<datastore>] 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/<cluster_id>-dynamic-pvc-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.vmdk
```

- The naming conventions require 205 characters of the 255 character limit.

- The depolyment determines the datastore name and the cluster ID.

- The datastore name and cluster ID substitute into the example pattern. The fully qualified path gets processed with the `systemd-escape` command to escape special characters. For example, after the escape operation, a hyphen character uses four characters, such as `\x2d`.

- After the `systemd-escape` CLI processes the VMDK file path, the length of the path must not be lower than 255 characters. This criteria ensures that the `systemd` process can access the fully qualified VMDK file path.

# Metrics for the vSphere Problem Detector Operator

The vSphere Problem Detector Operator exposes the following metrics for use by the OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack.

| Name | Description |
|----|----|
| `vsphere_cluster_check_total` | Cumulative number of cluster-level checks that the vSphere Problem Detector Operator performed. This count includes both successes and failures. |
| `vsphere_cluster_check_errors` | Number of failed cluster-level checks that the vSphere Problem Detector Operator performed. For example, a value of `1` indicates that one cluster-level check failed. |
| `vsphere_esxi_version_total` | Counts the number of ESXi hosts with a specific version. Note that if a host runs more than one node, the vSphere Problem Detector Operator counts the host only once. |
| `vsphere_node_check_total` | Cumulative number of node-level checks that the vSphere Problem Detector Operator performed. This count includes both successes and failures. |
| `vsphere_node_check_errors` | Counts the number of failed node-level checks that the vSphere Problem Detector Operator performed. For example, a value of `1` indicates that one node-level check failed. |
| `vsphere_node_hw_version_total` | Number of vSphere nodes with a specific hardware version. |
| `vsphere_vcenter_info` | Information about the vSphere vCenter Server. |
