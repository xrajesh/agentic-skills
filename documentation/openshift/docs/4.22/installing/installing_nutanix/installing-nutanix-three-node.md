In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.17, you can install a three-node cluster on Nutanix. A three-node cluster consists of three control plane machines, which also act as compute machines. This type of cluster provides a smaller, more resource efficient cluster, for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production.

# Configuring a three-node cluster

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To configure a three-node cluster, set the number of worker nodes to `0` in the `install-config.yaml` file before you deploy the cluster.

</div>

Setting the number of worker nodes to `0` ensures that the control plane machines are schedulable. This allows application workloads to be scheduled to run from the control plane nodes.

> [!NOTE]
> Because application workloads run from control plane nodes, additional subscriptions are required, as the control plane nodes are considered to be compute nodes.
