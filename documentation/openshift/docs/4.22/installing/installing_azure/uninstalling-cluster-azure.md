You can remove a cluster that you deployed to Microsoft Azure.

# Removing a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can remove a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure that you provisioned from your cloud platform.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> After uninstallation, check your cloud provider for any resources that were not removed properly, especially with user-provisioned infrastructure clusters. Some resources might exist because either the installation program did not create the resource or could not access the resource.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have a copy of the installation program that you used to deploy the cluster.

- You have the files that the installation program generated when you created your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  From the directory that has the installation program on the computer that you used to install the cluster, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install destroy cluster \
    --dir <installation_directory> --log-level info
    ```

    where:

    \<installation_directory\>
    Specify the path to the directory that you stored the installation files in.

    --log-level info
    To view different details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or `error` instead of `info`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must specify the directory that includes the cluster definition files for your cluster. The installation program requires the `metadata.json` file in this directory to delete the cluster.

2.  Optional: Delete the `<installation_directory>` directory and the OpenShift Container Platform installation program.

# Deleting Microsoft Azure resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

After uninstalling an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses short-term credentials managed outside the cluster, you can use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to remove the Microsoft Azure resources that `ccoctl` created during installation.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary.

- Uninstall an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Azure that uses short-term credentials.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- Delete the Azure resources that `ccoctl` created by running the following command:

  ``` terminal
  $ ccoctl azure delete \
    --name=<name> \
    --region=<azure_region> \
    --subscription-id=<azure_subscription_id> \
    --delete-oidc-resource-group
  ```

  where:

  `<name>`
  Matches the name that was originally used to create and tag the cloud resources.

  `<azure_region>`
  is the Azure region in which to delete cloud resources.

  `<azure_subscription_id>`
  is the Azure subscription ID for which to delete cloud resources.

</div>

Verification

</div>

- To verify that the resources are deleted, query Azure. For more information, refer to Azure documentation.
