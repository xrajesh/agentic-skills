In OpenShift Container Platform, you can install a cluster on Microsoft Azure by using infrastructure that you provide.

Several [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) (ARM) templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of OpenShift Container Platform. Several ARM templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods.

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You reviewed details about the [OpenShift Container Platform installation and update](../../../architecture/architecture-installation.xml#architecture-installation) processes.

- You read the documentation on [selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users](../../../installing/overview/installing-preparing.xml#installing-preparing).

- You [configured an Azure account](../../../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-account.xml#installing-azure-account) to host the cluster and determined the tested and validated region to deploy the cluster to.

- You [mirrored the images for a disconnected installation](../../../disconnected/installing-mirroring-installation-images.xml#installation-about-mirror-registry_installing-mirroring-installation-images) to your registry and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of OpenShift Container Platform.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you must use that computer to complete all installation steps.

- If you use a firewall, you [configured it to allow the sites](../../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.xml#configuring-firewall) that your cluster requires access to.

- If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you have [manually created long-term credentials](../../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-customizations.xml#manually-create-iam_installing-azure-customizations).

- If you use customer-managed encryption keys, you [prepared your Azure environment for encryption](../../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-preparing-ipi.xml#preparing-disk-encryption-sets_installing-azure-preparing-ipi).

</div>

# About installations in restricted networks

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, you can perform an installation that does not require an active connection to the internet to obtain software components. Restricted network installations can be completed using installer-provisioned infrastructure or user-provisioned infrastructure, depending on the cloud platform to which you are installing the cluster.

If you choose to perform a restricted network installation on a cloud platform, you still require access to its cloud APIs. Some cloud functions, like Amazon Web Service’s Route 53 DNS and IAM services, require internet access. Depending on your network, you might require less internet access for an installation on bare metal hardware, Nutanix, or on VMware vSphere.

To complete a restricted network installation, you must create a registry that mirrors the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contains the installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your closed network, or by using other methods that meet your restrictions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because of the complexity of the configuration for user-provisioned installations, consider completing a standard user-provisioned infrastructure installation before you attempt a restricted network installation using user-provisioned infrastructure. Completing this test installation might make it easier to isolate and troubleshoot any issues that might arise during your installation in a restricted network.

## Additional limits

Clusters in restricted networks have the following additional limitations and restrictions:

- The `ClusterVersion` status includes an `Unable to retrieve available updates` error.

- By default, you cannot use the contents of the Developer Catalog because you cannot access the required image stream tags.

## Internet access for OpenShift Container Platform

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, you require access to the internet to install your cluster.

</div>

You must have internet access to perform the following actions:

- Access [OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift) to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.

- Access [Quay.io](http://quay.io) to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.

- Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your cluster cannot have direct internet access, you can perform a restricted network installation on some types of infrastructure that you provision. During that process, you download the required content and use it to populate a mirror registry with the installation packages. With some installation types, the environment that you install your cluster in will not require internet access. Before you update the cluster, you update the content of the mirror registry.

# Configuring your Azure project

Before you can install OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure an Azure project to host it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see [Resolve reserved resource name errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-reserved-resource-name) in the Azure documentation.

## Azure account limits

The OpenShift Container Platform cluster uses a number of Microsoft Azure components, and the default [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits) affect your ability to install OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Default limits vary by offer category types, such as Free Trial and Pay-As-You-Go, and by series, such as Dv2, F, and G. For example, the default for Enterprise Agreement subscriptions is 350 cores.
>
> Check the limits for your subscription type and if necessary, increase quota limits for your account before you install a default cluster on Azure.

The following table summarizes the Azure components whose limits can impact your ability to install and run OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

## Configuring a public DNS zone in Azure

To install OpenShift Container Platform, the Microsoft Azure account you use must have a dedicated public hosted DNS zone in your account. This zone must be authoritative for the domain. This service provides cluster DNS resolution and name lookup for external connections to the cluster.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Identify your domain, or subdomain, and registrar. You can transfer an existing domain and registrar or obtain a new one through Azure or another source.

    - To purchase a new domain through Azure, see [Buy a custom domain name for Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/manage-custom-dns-buy-domain).

    - If you are using an existing domain and registrar, migrate its DNS to Azure. For more information, see [Migrate an active DNS name to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/manage-custom-dns-migrate-domain) in the Azure documentation.

2.  Configure DNS for your domain, which includes creating a public hosted zone for your domain or subdomain, extracting the new authoritative name servers, and updating the registrar records for the name servers that your domain uses. For more information, see [Tutorial: Host your domain in Azure DNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns).

    Use an appropriate root domain, such as `openshiftcorp.com`, or subdomain, such as `clusters.openshiftcorp.com`.

3.  If you use a subdomain, follow your organization’s procedures to add its delegation records to the parent domain.

</div>

You can view Azure’s DNS solution by visiting this [example for creating DNS zones](#installation-azure-create-dns-zones_installing-restricted-networks-azure-user-provisioned).

## Certificate signing requests management

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

On user-provisioned infrastructure, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation when your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management.

</div>

The `kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The `machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

## Required Azure roles

Before you create the identity, verify that your environment meets the following requirements based on the identity:

- The Azure account that you use to create the identity is assigned the `User Access Administrator` and `Contributor` roles. These roles are required when:

  - Creating a service principal or user-assigned managed identity.

  - Enabling a system-assigned managed identity on a virtual machine.

- If you are going to use a service principal to complete the installation, verify that the Azure account that you use to create the identity is assigned the `microsoft.directory/servicePrincipals/createAsOwner` permission in Microsoft Entra ID.

To set roles on the Azure portal, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) in the Azure documentation.

## Required Azure permissions for user-provisioned infrastructure

The installation program requires access to an Azure service principal or managed identity with the necessary permissions to deploy the cluster and to maintain its daily operation. These permissions must be granted to the Azure subscription that is associated with the identity.

The following options are available to you:

- You can assign the identity the `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles. Assigning these roles is the quickest way to grant all of the required permissions.

  For more information about assigning roles, see the Azure documentation for [managing access to Azure resources using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

- If your organization’s security policies require a more restrictive set of permissions, you can create a [custom role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) with the necessary permissions.

The following permissions are required for creating an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Microsoft Azure.

## Creating a service principal

Because OpenShift Container Platform and its installation program create Microsoft Azure resources by using the Azure Resource Manager, you must create a service principal to represent it.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Install or update the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-yum?view=azure-cli-latest).

- Your Azure account has the required roles for the subscription that you use.

- If you want to use a custom role, you have created a [custom role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) with the required permissions listed in the *Required Azure permissions for user-provisioned infrastructure* section.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Log in to the Azure CLI:

    ``` terminal
    $ az login
    ```

2.  If your Azure account uses subscriptions, ensure that you are using the right subscription:

    1.  View the list of available accounts and record the `tenantId` value for the subscription you want to use for your cluster:

        ``` terminal
        $ az account list --refresh
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

        Example output

            }
          }
        ]
        ```

        </div>

    2.  View your active account details and confirm that the `tenantId` value matches the subscription you want to use:

        ``` terminal
        $ az account show
        ```

# Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

This section describes the requirements for deploying OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure.

## Required machines for cluster installation

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You must specify the minimum required machines or hosts for your cluster so that your cluster remains stable if a node fails.

</div>

The smallest OpenShift Container Platform clusters require the following hosts:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

| Hosts | Description |
|----|----|
| One temporary bootstrap machine | The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after you install the cluster. |
| Three control plane machines | The control plane machines run the Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform services that form the control plane. |
| At least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines. | The workloads requested by OpenShift Container Platform users run on the compute machines. |

Minimum required hosts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for these cluster machines.

The bootstrap and control plane machines must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system. However, the compute machines can choose between Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6 and later.

Note that RHCOS is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.2 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements. See [Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits).

## Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Each created cluster must meet minimum requirements so that the cluster runs as expected.

</div>

| Machine | Operating System | vCPU <sup>\[1\]</sup> | Virtual RAM | Storage | Input/Output Per Second (IOPS)<sup>\[2\]</sup> |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Bootstrap | RHCOS | 4 | 16 GB | 100 GB | 300 |
| Control plane | RHCOS | 4 | 16 GB | 100 GB | 300 |
| Compute | RHCOS | 2 | 8 GB | 100 GB | 300 |

Minimum resource requirements

<div wrapper="1" role="small">

1.  One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.

2.  OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.

3.  As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of RHEL 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> For OpenShift Container Platform version 4.19, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.6, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:
>
> - x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
>
> - ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
>
> - IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
>
> - s390x architecture requires z14 ISA
>
> For more information, see [Architectures](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/9.2_release_notes/index#architectures) (RHEL documentation).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You are required to use Azure virtual machines that have the `premiumIO` parameter set to `true`.

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in OpenShift Container Platform.

## Tested instance types for Azure

The following Microsoft Azure instance types have been tested with OpenShift Container Platform.

# Using the Azure Marketplace offering

Using the Azure Marketplace offering lets you deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, which is billed on pay-per-use basis (hourly, per core) through Azure, while still being supported directly by Red Hat.

To deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using the Azure Marketplace offering, you must first obtain the Azure Marketplace image. The installation program uses this image to deploy worker or control plane nodes. When obtaining your image, consider the following:

- While the images are the same, the Azure Marketplace publisher is different depending on your region. If you are located in North America, specify `redhat` as the publisher. If you are located in EMEA, specify `redhat-limited` as the publisher.

- The offer includes a `rh-ocp-worker` SKU and a `rh-ocp-worker-gen1` SKU. The `rh-ocp-worker` SKU represents a Hyper-V generation version 2 VM image. The default instance types used in OpenShift Container Platform are version 2 compatible. If you plan to use an instance type that is only version 1 compatible, use the image associated with the `rh-ocp-worker-gen1` SKU. The `rh-ocp-worker-gen1` SKU represents a Hyper-V version 1 VM image.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing images with the Azure marketplace is not supported on clusters with 64-bit ARM instances.
>
> You should only modify the RHCOS image for compute machines to use an Azure Marketplace image. Control plane machines and infrastructure nodes do not require an OpenShift Container Platform subscription and use the public RHCOS default image by default, which does not incur subscription costs on your Azure bill. Therefore, you should not modify the cluster default boot image or the control plane boot images. Applying the Azure Marketplace image to them will incur additional licensing costs that cannot be recovered.

<div>

</div>

## Obtaining the installation program

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on the host you are using for installation.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Go to the [Cluster Type](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install) page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also [download the binaries for a specific OpenShift Container Platform release](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/).

2.  Select your infrastructure provider from the **Run it yourself** section of the page.

3.  Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under **OpenShift Installer** and click **Download Installer**.

4.  Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > - The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
    >
    > - Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.

5.  Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
    ```

6.  Download your installation [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret). This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for OpenShift Container Platform components.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/), where you can specify a version of the installation program to download. However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.

</div>

## Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To enable secure, passwordless SSH access to your cluster nodes, provide an SSH public key during the OpenShift Container Platform installation. This ensures that the installation program automatically configures the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes for remote authentication through the `core` user.

</div>

The SSH public key gets added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node. After the key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user `core`. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The `./openshift-install gather` command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name>
    ```

    Specifies the path and file name, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your `~/.ssh` directory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you plan to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures, do not create a key that uses the `ed25519` algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the `rsa` or `ecdsa` algorithm.

2.  View the public SSH key:

    ``` terminal
    $ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
    ```

    For example, run the following to view the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` public key:

    ``` terminal
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

3.  Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the `./openshift-install gather` command.

    > [!NOTE]
    > On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_dsa` are managed automatically.

    1.  If the `ssh-agent` process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

        ``` terminal
        $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

        Example output

        </div>

        ``` terminal
        Agent pid 31874
        ```

        </div>

        > [!NOTE]
        > If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.

4.  Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`:

    ``` terminal
    $ ssh-add <path>/<file_name>
    ```

    Specifies the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
    ```

    </div>

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Next steps

</div>

- When you install OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program. If you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision, you must provide the key to the installation program.

</div>

# Creating the installation files for Azure

To install OpenShift Container Platform on Microsoft Azure using user-provisioned infrastructure, you must generate the files that the installation program needs to deploy your cluster and modify them so that the cluster creates only the machines that it will use. You generate and customize the `install-config.yaml` file, Kubernetes manifests, and Ignition config files. You also have the option to first set up a separate `var` partition during the preparation phases of installation.

## Optional: Creating a separate `/var` partition

It is recommended that disk partitioning for OpenShift Container Platform be left to the installer. However, there are cases where you might want to create separate partitions in a part of the filesystem that you expect to grow.

OpenShift Container Platform supports the addition of a single partition to attach storage to either the `/var` partition or a subdirectory of `/var`. For example:

- `/var/lib/containers`: Holds container-related content that can grow as more images and containers are added to a system.

- `/var/lib/etcd`: Holds data that you might want to keep separate for purposes such as performance optimization of etcd storage.

- `/var`: Holds data that you might want to keep separate for purposes such as auditing.

Storing the contents of a `/var` directory separately makes it easier to grow storage for those areas as needed and reinstall OpenShift Container Platform at a later date and keep that data intact. With this method, you will not have to pull all your containers again, nor will you have to copy massive log files when you update systems.

Because `/var` must be in place before a fresh installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), the following procedure sets up the separate `/var` partition by creating a machine config manifest that is inserted during the `openshift-install` preparation phases of an OpenShift Container Platform installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you follow the steps to create a separate `/var` partition in this procedure, it is not necessary to create the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files again as described later in this section.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create a directory to hold the OpenShift Container Platform installation files:

    ``` terminal
    $ mkdir $HOME/clusterconfig
    ```

2.  Run `openshift-install` to create a set of files in the `manifest` and `openshift` subdirectories. Answer the system questions as you are prompted:

    ``` terminal
    $ openshift-install create manifests --dir $HOME/clusterconfig
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    ? SSH Public Key ...
    INFO Credentials loaded from the "myprofile" profile in file "/home/myuser/.aws/credentials"
    INFO Consuming Install Config from target directory
    INFO Manifests created in: $HOME/clusterconfig/manifests and $HOME/clusterconfig/openshift
    ```

    </div>

3.  Optional: Confirm that the installation program created manifests in the `clusterconfig/openshift` directory:

    ``` terminal
    $ ls $HOME/clusterconfig/openshift/
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    99_kubeadmin-password-secret.yaml
    99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-0.yaml
    99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-1.yaml
    99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-2.yaml
    ...
    ```

    </div>

4.  Create a Butane config that configures the additional partition. For example, name the file `$HOME/clusterconfig/98-var-partition.bu`, change the disk device name to the name of the storage device on the `worker` systems, and set the storage size as appropriate. This example places the `/var` directory on a separate partition:

    ``` yaml
    variant: openshift
    version: 4.17.0
    metadata:
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
      name: 98-var-partition
    storage:
      disks:
      - device: /dev/disk/by-id/<device_name>
        partitions:
        - label: var
          start_mib: <partition_start_offset>
          size_mib: <partition_size>
          number: 5
      filesystems:
        - device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/var
          path: /var
          format: xfs
          mount_options: [defaults, prjquota]
          with_mount_unit: true
    ```

    - The storage device name of the disk that you want to partition.

    - When adding a data partition to the boot disk, a minimum value of 25000 MiB (Mebibytes) is recommended. The root file system is automatically resized to fill all available space up to the specified offset. If no value is specified, or if the specified value is smaller than the recommended minimum, the resulting root file system will be too small, and future reinstalls of RHCOS might overwrite the beginning of the data partition.

    - The size of the data partition in mebibytes.

    - The `prjquota` mount option must be enabled for filesystems used for container storage.

      > [!NOTE]
      > When creating a separate `/var` partition, you cannot use different instance types for worker nodes, if the different instance types do not have the same device name.

5.  Create a manifest from the Butane config and save it to the `clusterconfig/openshift` directory. For example, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ butane $HOME/clusterconfig/98-var-partition.bu -o $HOME/clusterconfig/openshift/98-var-partition.yaml
    ```

6.  Run `openshift-install` again to create Ignition configs from a set of files in the `manifest` and `openshift` subdirectories:

    ``` terminal
    $ openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir $HOME/clusterconfig
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ ls $HOME/clusterconfig/
    auth  bootstrap.ign  master.ign  metadata.json  worker.ign
    ```

    You can now use the Ignition config files as input to the installation procedures to install Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) systems.

</div>

## Creating the installation configuration file

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can customize the OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on Microsoft Azure.

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not specify `windows`, `microsoft`, or other variants of these words in the `metadata.name` parameter of the `install-config.yaml` file. Specifying one of these words for the cluster name causes the installation program to generate an error message like the following example message:
>
> ``` terminal
> The resource name 'windows-xxxx-identity' or a part of the name is a trademarked or reserved word.
> ```
>
> Additionally, specifying `login` at the beginning of the name in the `metadata.name` parameter of the `install-config.yaml` file results in the generation of an error message. You can specify `login` in the middle or end of the name.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster. For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.

- You have the `imageContentSources` values that were generated during mirror registry creation.

- You have obtained the contents of the certificate for your mirror registry.

- You have retrieved a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image and uploaded it to an accessible location.

- You have an Azure subscription ID and tenant ID.

- If you are installing the cluster using a service principal, you have its application ID and password.

- If you are installing the cluster using a system-assigned managed identity, you have enabled it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.

- If you are installing the cluster using a user-assigned managed identity, you have met these prerequisites:

  - You have its client ID.

  - You have assigned it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal or managed identity, go to the `~/.azure/` directory and delete the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file.

    Deleting this file prevents the installation program from automatically reusing subscription and authentication values from a previous installation.

2.  Create the `install-config.yaml` file.

    1.  Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory>
        ```

        - `<installation_directory>`: For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the files that the installation program creates.

          When specifying the directory:

        - Verify that the directory has the `execute` permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.

        - Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.

    2.  At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:

        1.  Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

            > [!NOTE]
            > For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.

        2.  Select **azure** as the platform to target.

            If the installation program cannot locate the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file from a previous installation, you are prompted for Azure subscription and authentication values.

        3.  Enter the following Azure parameter values for your subscription:

            - **azure subscription id**: Enter the subscription ID to use for the cluster.

            - **azure tenant id**: Enter the tenant ID.

        4.  Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the **azure service principal client id**:

            - If you are using a service principal, enter its application ID.

            - If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.

            - If you are using a user-assigned managed identity, specify its client ID.

        5.  Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the **azure service principal client secret**:

            - If you are using a service principal, enter its password.

            - If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.

            - If you are using a user-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.

        6.  Select the region to deploy the cluster to.

        7.  Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds to the Azure DNS Zone that you created for your cluster.

        8.  Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.

            > [!IMPORTANT]
            > All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see [Resolve reserved resource name errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-reserved-resource-name) in the Azure documentation.

        9.  Paste the [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret).

3.  Edit the `install-config.yaml` file to give the additional information that is required for an installation in a restricted network.

    1.  Update the `pullSecret` value to contain the authentication information for your registry:

        ``` yaml
        pullSecret: '{"auths":{"<mirror_host_name>:5000": {"auth": "<credentials>","email": "you@example.com"}}}'
        ```

        For `<mirror_host_name>`, specify the registry domain name that you specified in the certificate for your mirror registry, and for `<credentials>`, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry.

    2.  Add the `additionalTrustBundle` parameter and value.

        ``` yaml
        additionalTrustBundle: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        ```

        The value must be the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry. The certificate file can be an existing, trusted certificate authority, or the self-signed certificate that you generated for the mirror registry.

    3.  Define the network and subnets for the VNet to install the cluster under the `platform.azure` field:

        ``` yaml
        networkResourceGroupName: <vnet_resource_group>
        virtualNetwork: <vnet>
        controlPlaneSubnet: <control_plane_subnet>
        computeSubnet: <compute_subnet>
        ```

        where:

        `<vnet_resource_group>`
        Specifies the resource group name that contains the existing virtual network (VNet).

        `<vnet>`
        Specifies the existing virtual network name.

        `<control_plane_subnet>`
        Specifies the existing subnet name to deploy the control plane machines.

        `<compute_subnet>`
        Specifies the existing subnet name to deploy compute machines.

    4.  Add the image content resources, which resemble the following YAML excerpt:

        ``` yaml
        imageContentSources:
        - mirrors:
          - <mirror_host_name>:5000/<repo_name>/release
          source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
        - mirrors:
          - <mirror_host_name>:5000/<repo_name>/release
          source: registry.redhat.io/ocp/release
        ```

        For these values, use the `imageContentSources` that you recorded during mirror registry creation.

    5.  Optionally, set the publishing strategy to `Internal`:

        ``` yaml
        publish: Internal
        ```

        By setting this option, you create an internal Ingress Controller and a private load balancer.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Azure Firewall [does not work seamlessly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/integrate-lb) with Azure Public Load balancers. Thus, when using Azure Firewall for restricting internet access, the `publish` field in `install-config.yaml` should be set to `Internal`.

4.  Make any other modifications to the `install-config.yaml` file that you require.

    For more information about the parameters, see "Installation configuration parameters".

5.  Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install multiple clusters.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the installation process. If you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.

    If previously not detected, the installation program creates an `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file and stores this file in the `~/.azure/` directory on your computer. This ensures that the installation program can load the profile when it is creating an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the target platform.

</div>

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To enable internet access in environments that deny direct connections, configure a cluster-wide proxy in the `install-config.yaml` file. This configuration ensures that the new OpenShift Container Platform cluster routes traffic through the specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

- You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object’s `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is populated with the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration.
  >
  > For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    baseDomain: my.domain.com
    proxy:
      httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
      httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
      noProxy: example.com
    additionalTrustBundle: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `proxy.httpProxy`
    Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`.

    `proxy.httpsProxy`
    Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.

    `proxy.noProxy`
    Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations.

    `additionalTrustBundle`
    If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named `user-ca-bundle` in the `openshift-config` namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you provide `additionalTrustBundle` and at least one proxy setting, the `Proxy` object is configured to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a `trusted-ca-bundle` config map that merges the contents specified for the `trustedCA` parameter with the RHCOS trust bundle. The `additionalTrustBundle` field is required unless the proxy’s identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.

    `additionalTrustBundlePolicy`
    Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the `Proxy` object to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The allowed values are `Proxyonly` and `Always`. Use `Proxyonly` to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map only when `http/https` proxy is configured. Use `Always` to always reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map. The default value is `Proxyonly`. Optional parameter.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the installation program times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installation program. For example:
    >
    > ``` terminal
    > $ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
    > ```

2.  Save the file and reference it when installing OpenShift Container Platform.

    The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named `cluster` that uses the proxy settings in the provided `install-config.yaml` file. If no proxy settings are provided, a `cluster` `Proxy` object is still created, but it will have a nil `spec`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.

</div>

## Exporting common variables for ARM templates

You must export a common set of variables that are used with the provided Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates used to assist in completing a user-provided infrastructure install on Microsoft Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> Specific ARM templates can also require additional exported variables, which are detailed in their related procedures.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Obtain the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Export common variables found in the `install-config.yaml` to be used by the provided ARM templates:

    ``` terminal
    $ export CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster_name>
    ```

    where:

    `<cluster_name>`
    The value of the `.metadata.name` attribute from the `install-config.yaml` file.

    ``` terminal
    $ export AZURE_REGION=<azure_region>
    ```

    where:

    `<azure_region>`
    The region to deploy the cluster into, for example `centralus`. This is the value of the `.platform.azure.region` attribute from the `install-config.yaml` file.

    ``` terminal
    $ export SSH_KEY=<ssh_key>
    ```

    where:

    `<ssh_key>`
    The SSH RSA public key file as a string. You must enclose the SSH key in quotes since it contains spaces. This is the value of the `.sshKey` attribute from the `install-config.yaml` file.

    ``` terminal
    $ export BASE_DOMAIN=<base_domain>
    ```

    where:

    `<base_domain>`
    The base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds to the public DNS zone that you created for your cluster. This is the value of the `.baseDomain` attribute from the `install-config.yaml` file.

    ``` terminal
    $ export BASE_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_GROUP=<base_domain_resource_group>
    ```

    where:

    `<base_domain_resource_group>`
    The resource group where the public DNS zone exists. This is the value of the `.platform.azure.baseDomainResourceGroupName` attribute from the `install-config.yaml` file.

    For example:

    ``` terminal
    $ export CLUSTER_NAME=test-cluster
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ export AZURE_REGION=centralus
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ export SSH_KEY="ssh-rsa xxx/xxx/xxx= user@email.com"
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ export BASE_DOMAIN=example.com
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ export BASE_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_GROUP=ocp-cluster
    ```

2.  Export the kubeadmin credentials:

    ``` terminal
    $ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
    ```

    where:

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specify the path to the directory that you stored the installation files in.

</div>

## Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To customize cluster definitions and manually start machines, generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files. These assets provide the necessary instructions to configure the cluster infrastructure according to your specific deployment requirements.

</div>

The installation configuration file transforms into the Kubernetes manifests. The manifests wrap into the Ignition configuration files, which are later used to configure the cluster machines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The Ignition config files that the OpenShift Container Platform installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for *Recovering from expired control plane certificates* for more information.
>
> - It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program.

- You created the `install-config.yaml` installation configuration file.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Change to the directory that contains the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
    ```

    where

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specifies the installation directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file you created.

2.  Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machines:

    ``` terminal
    $ rm -f <installation_directory>/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml
    ```

    By removing these files, you prevent the cluster from automatically generating control plane machines.

3.  Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machine set:

    ``` terminal
    $ rm -f <installation_directory>/openshift/99_openshift-machine-api_master-control-plane-machine-set.yaml
    ```

4.  Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the worker machines:

    ``` terminal
    $ rm -f <installation_directory>/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*.yaml
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you disabled the `MachineAPI` capability when installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the worker machines. Otherwise, your cluster fails to install.

    Because you create and manage the worker machines yourself, you do not need to initialize these machines.

5.  Check that the `mastersSchedulable` parameter in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` Kubernetes manifest file is set to `false`. This setting prevents pods from being scheduled on the control plane machines:

    1.  Open the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` file.

    2.  Locate the `mastersSchedulable` parameter and ensure that it is set to `false`.

    3.  Save and exit the file.

6.  Optional: If you do not want [the Ingress Operator](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-ingress-operator) to create DNS records on your behalf, remove the `privateZone` and `publicZone` sections from the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-dns-02-config.yml` DNS configuration file:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
    kind: DNS
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      name: cluster
    spec:
      baseDomain: example.openshift.com
      privateZone:
        id: mycluster-100419-private-zone
      publicZone:
        id: example.openshift.com
    status: {}
    ```

    `spec.privateZone`: Remove this section completely.

    If you do so, you must add ingress DNS records manually in a later step.

7.  When configuring Azure on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must export some common variables defined in the manifest files to use later in the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates:

    1.  Export the infrastructure ID by using the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ export INFRA_ID=<infra_id>
        ```

        where:

        `<infra_id>`
        Specifies that the OpenShift Container Platform cluster has been assigned an identifier (`INFRA_ID`) in the form of `<cluster_name>-<random_string>`. This identifier is used as the base name for most resources created using the provided ARM templates. This is the value of the `.status.infrastructureName` attribute from the `manifests/cluster-infrastructure-02-config.yml` file.

    2.  Export the resource group by using the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ export RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource_group>
        ```

        where:

        `<resource_group>`
        All resources created in this Azure deployment exists as part of a [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview#resource-groups). The resource group name is also based on the `INFRA_ID`, in the form of `<cluster_name>-<random_string>-rg`. This is the value of the `.status.platformStatus.azure.resourceGroupName` attribute from the `manifests/cluster-infrastructure-02-config.yml` file.

8.  To create the Ignition configuration files, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir <installation_directory>
    ```

    where:

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specifies the same installation directory.

    Ignition config files are created for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes in the installation directory. The `kubeadmin-password` and `kubeconfig` files are created in the `./<installation_directory>/auth` directory:

        .
        ├── auth
        │   ├── kubeadmin-password
        │   └── kubeconfig
        ├── bootstrap.ign
        ├── master.ign
        ├── metadata.json
        └── worker.ign

# Creating the Azure resource group

You must create a Microsoft Azure [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview#resource-groups) and an identity for that resource group. These are both used during the installation of your OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Azure.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create the resource group in a supported Azure region:

    ``` terminal
    $ az group create --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --location ${AZURE_REGION}
    ```

2.  Create an Azure identity for the resource group:

    ``` terminal
    $ az identity create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -n ${INFRA_ID}-identity
    ```

    This is used to grant the required access to Operators in your cluster. For example, this allows the Ingress Operator to create a public IP and its load balancer. You must assign the Azure identity to a role.

3.  Grant the Contributor role to the Azure identity:

    1.  Export the following variables required by the Azure role assignment:

        ``` terminal
        $ export PRINCIPAL_ID=`az identity show -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -n ${INFRA_ID}-identity --query principalId --out tsv`
        ```

        ``` terminal
        $ export RESOURCE_GROUP_ID=`az group show -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --query id --out tsv`
        ```

    2.  Assign the Contributor role to the identity:

        ``` terminal
        $ az role assignment create --assignee "${PRINCIPAL_ID}" --role 'Contributor' --scope "${RESOURCE_GROUP_ID}"
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you want to assign a custom role with all the required permissions to the identity, run the following command:
        >
        > ``` terminal
        > $ az role assignment create --assignee "${PRINCIPAL_ID}" --role <custom_role> \
        > --scope "${RESOURCE_GROUP_ID}"
        > ```
        >
        > - Specifies the custom role name.

# Uploading the RHCOS cluster image and bootstrap Ignition config file

The Azure client does not support deployments based on files existing locally. You must copy and store the RHCOS virtual hard disk (VHD) cluster image and bootstrap Ignition config file in a storage container so they are accessible during deployment.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Generate the Ignition config files for your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create an Azure storage account to store the VHD cluster image:

    ``` terminal
    $ az storage account create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --location ${AZURE_REGION} --name ${CLUSTER_NAME}sa --kind Storage --sku Standard_LRS
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > The Azure storage account name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and use numbers and lower-case letters only. If your `CLUSTER_NAME` variable does not follow these restrictions, you must manually define the Azure storage account name. For more information on Azure storage account name restrictions, see [Resolve errors for storage account names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-storage-account-name) in the Azure documentation.

2.  Export the storage account key as an environment variable:

    ``` terminal
    $ export ACCOUNT_KEY=`az storage account keys list -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --account-name ${CLUSTER_NAME}sa --query "[0].value" -o tsv`
    ```

3.  Export the URL of the RHCOS VHD to an environment variable:

    ``` terminal
    $ export VHD_URL=`openshift-install coreos print-stream-json | jq -r '.architectures.<architecture>."rhel-coreos-extensions"."azure-disk".url'`
    ```

    where:

    `<architecture>`
    Specifies the architecture, valid values include `x86_64` or `aarch64`.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The RHCOS images might not change with every release of OpenShift Container Platform. You must specify an image with the highest version that is less than or equal to the OpenShift Container Platform version that you install. Use the image version that matches your OpenShift Container Platform version if it is available.

4.  Create the storage container for the VHD:

    ``` terminal
    $ az storage container create --name vhd --account-name ${CLUSTER_NAME}sa --account-key ${ACCOUNT_KEY}
    ```

5.  Copy the local VHD to a blob:

    ``` terminal
    $ az storage blob copy start --account-name ${CLUSTER_NAME}sa --account-key ${ACCOUNT_KEY} --destination-blob "rhcos.vhd" --destination-container vhd --source-uri "${VHD_URL}"
    ```

6.  Create a blob storage container and upload the generated `bootstrap.ign` file:

    ``` terminal
    $ az storage container create --name files --account-name ${CLUSTER_NAME}sa --account-key ${ACCOUNT_KEY}
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ az storage blob upload --account-name ${CLUSTER_NAME}sa --account-key ${ACCOUNT_KEY} -c "files" -f "<installation_directory>/bootstrap.ign" -n "bootstrap.ign"
    ```

# Example for creating DNS zones

DNS records are required for clusters that use user-provisioned infrastructure. You should choose the DNS strategy that fits your scenario.

For this example, [Azure’s DNS solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview) is used, so you will create a new public DNS zone for external (internet) visibility and a private DNS zone for internal cluster resolution.

> [!NOTE]
> The public DNS zone is not required to exist in the same resource group as the cluster deployment and might already exist in your organization for the desired base domain. If that is the case, you can skip creating the public DNS zone; be sure the installation config you generated earlier reflects that scenario.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create the new public DNS zone in the resource group exported in the `BASE_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_GROUP` environment variable:

    ``` terminal
    $ az network dns zone create -g ${BASE_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_GROUP} -n ${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN}
    ```

    You can skip this step if you are using a public DNS zone that already exists.

2.  Create the private DNS zone in the same resource group as the rest of this deployment:

    ``` terminal
    $ az network private-dns zone create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -n ${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN}
    ```

</div>

You can learn more about [configuring a public DNS zone in Azure](#installation-azure-network-config_installing-restricted-networks-azure-user-provisioned) by visiting that section.

# Creating a VNet in Azure

You must create a virtual network (VNet) in Microsoft Azure for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use. You can customize the VNet to meet your requirements. One way to create the VNet is to modify the provided Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not use the provided ARM template to create your Azure infrastructure, you must review the provided information and manually create the infrastructure. If your cluster does not initialize correctly, you might have to contact Red Hat support with your installation logs.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Copy the template from the **ARM template for the VNet** section of this topic and save it as `01_vnet.json` in your cluster’s installation directory. This template describes the VNet that your cluster requires.

2.  Create the deployment by using the `az` CLI:

    ``` terminal
    $ az deployment group create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
      --template-file "<installation_directory>/01_vnet.json" \
      --parameters baseName="${INFRA_ID}"
    ```

    - The base name to be used in resource names; this is usually the cluster’s infrastructure ID.

3.  Link the VNet template to the private DNS zone:

    ``` terminal
    $ az network private-dns link vnet create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -z ${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN} -n ${INFRA_ID}-network-link -v "${INFRA_ID}-vnet" -e false
    ```

> If you do not use the provided ARM template to create your Azure infrastructure, you must review the provided information and manually create the infrastructure. If your cluster does not initialize correctly, you might have to contact Red Hat support with your installation logs.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Create and configure a VNet and associated subnets in Azure.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Copy the template from the **ARM template for the network and load balancers** section of this topic and save it as `03_infra.json` in your cluster’s installation directory. This template describes the networking and load balancing objects that your cluster requires.

2.  Create the deployment by using the `az` CLI:

    ``` terminal
    $ az deployment group create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
      --template-file "<installation_directory>/03_infra.json" \
      --parameters privateDNSZoneName="${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN}" \
      --parameters baseName="${INFRA_ID}"
    ```

    - The name of the private DNS zone.

    - The base name to be used in resource names; this is usually the cluster’s infrastructure ID.

3.  Create an `api` DNS record in the public zone for the API public load balancer. The `${BASE_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_GROUP}` variable must point to the resource group where the public DNS zone exists.

    1.  Export the following variable:

        ``` terminal
        $ export PUBLIC_IP=`az network public-ip list -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --query "[?name=='${INFRA_ID}-master-pip'] | [0].ipAddress" -o tsv`

# Creating additional worker machines in Azure

You can create worker machines in Microsoft Azure for your cluster to use by launching individual instances discretely or by automated processes outside the cluster, such as auto scaling groups. You can also take advantage of the built-in cluster scaling mechanisms and the machine API in OpenShift Container Platform.

In this example, you manually launch one instance by using the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. Additional instances can be launched by including additional resources of type `06_workers.json` in the file.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Microsoft Azure places control plane machines and compute machines in a pre-set availability zone. You can manually set an availability zone for a compute node or control plane node. To do this, modify a vendor’s ARM template by specifying each of your availability zones in the `zones` parameter of the virtual machine resource.

2.  Export the following variable needed by the worker machine deployment:

    ``` terminal
    $ export WORKER_IGNITION=`cat <installation_directory>/worker.ign | base64 | tr -d '\n'`
    ```

3.  Create the deployment by using the `az` CLI:

    ``` terminal
    $ az deployment group create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
      --template-file "<installation_directory>/06_workers.json" \
      --parameters workerIgnition="${WORKER_IGNITION}" \
      --parameters baseName="${INFRA_ID}" \
      --parameters nodeVMSize="Standard_D4s_v3"
    ```

    - The Ignition content for the worker nodes.

    - The base name to be used in resource names; this is usually the cluster’s infrastructure ID.

    - Optional: Specify the size of the compute node VM. Use a VM size compatible with your specified architecture. If this value is not defined, the default value from the template is set.

# Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To add machines to a cluster, verify the status of the certificate signing requests (CSRs) generated for each machine. If manual approval is required, approve the client requests first, followed by the server requests.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You added machines to your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get nodes
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
    master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.34.2
    master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.34.2
    master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.34.2
    ```

    </div>

    The output lists all of the machines that you created.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.

2.  Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
    csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
    csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
    ...
    ```

    </div>

    In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.

3.  If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

    > [!NOTE]
    > Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the `machine-approver` if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups, and confirm the identity of the node.

    - To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
      ```

      where:

      `<csr_name>`
      Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

    - To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.

4.  Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
    csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
    csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
    ...
    ```

    </div>

5.  If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

    - To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
      ```

      where:

      `<csr_name>`
      Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

    - To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
      ```

6.  After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get nodes
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
    master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.34.2
    master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.34.2
    master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.34.2
    worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.34.2
    worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.34.2
    ```

    </div>

    > [!NOTE]
    > It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the `Ready` status.

# Adding the Ingress DNS records

If you removed the DNS Zone configuration when creating Kubernetes manifests and generating Ignition configs, you must manually create DNS records that point at the Ingress load balancer. You can create either a wildcard `*.apps.{baseDomain}.` or specific records. You can use A, CNAME, and other records per your requirements.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You deployed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Microsoft Azure by using infrastructure that you provisioned.

- Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

- Install or update the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-yum?view=azure-cli-latest).

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Confirm the Ingress router has created a load balancer and populated the `EXTERNAL-IP` field:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc -n openshift-ingress get service router-default
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE
    router-default   LoadBalancer   172.30.20.10   35.130.120.110   80:32288/TCP,443:31215/TCP   20
    ```

    </div>

2.  Export the Ingress router IP as a variable:

    ``` terminal
    $ export PUBLIC_IP_ROUTER=`oc -n openshift-ingress get service router-default --no-headers | awk '{print $4}'`
    ```

3.  Add a `*.apps` record to the public DNS zone.

    1.  If you are adding this cluster to a new public zone, run:

        ``` terminal
        $ az network dns record-set a add-record -g ${BASE_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_GROUP} -z ${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN} -n *.apps -a ${PUBLIC_IP_ROUTER} --ttl 300
        ```

    2.  If you are adding this cluster to an already existing public zone, run:

        ``` terminal
        $ az network dns record-set a add-record -g ${BASE_DOMAIN_RESOURCE_GROUP} -z ${BASE_DOMAIN} -n *.apps.${CLUSTER_NAME} -a ${PUBLIC_IP_ROUTER} --ttl 300
        ```

4.  Add a `*.apps` record to the private DNS zone:

    1.  Create a `*.apps` record by using the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ az network private-dns record-set a create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -z ${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN} -n *.apps --ttl 300
        ```

    2.  Add the `*.apps` record to the private DNS zone by using the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ az network private-dns record-set a add-record -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -z ${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN} -n *.apps -a ${PUBLIC_IP_ROUTER}
        ```

</div>

If you prefer to add explicit domains instead of using a wildcard, you can create entries for each of the cluster’s current routes:

``` terminal
$ oc get --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{range .status.ingress[*]}{"\n"}{end}{end}' routes
```

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example output

# Completing an Azure installation on user-provisioned infrastructure

After you start the OpenShift Container Platform installation on Microsoft Azure user-provisioned infrastructure, you can monitor the cluster events until the cluster is ready.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Deploy the bootstrap machine for an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on user-provisioned Azure infrastructure.

- Install the `oc` CLI and log in.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- Complete the cluster installation:

  ``` terminal
  $ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for install-complete
  ```

  <div class="formalpara">

  <div class="title">

  Example output

  </div>

  ``` terminal
  INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster to initialize...
  ```

  </div>

  - For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you stored the installation files in.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > - The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for *Recovering from expired control plane certificates* for more information.
    >
    > - It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

# Telemetry access for OpenShift Container Platform

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, the Telemetry service requires internet access. When connected, this service runs automatically by default and registers your cluster to [OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift).
