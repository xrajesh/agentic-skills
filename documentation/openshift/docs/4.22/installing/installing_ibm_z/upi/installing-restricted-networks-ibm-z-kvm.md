In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.17, you can install a cluster on IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a disconnected environment.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> While this document refers to only IBM Z®, all information in it also applies to IBM® LinuxONE.

# Prerequisites

- You have completed the tasks in [Preparing to install a cluster on IBM Z using user-provisioned infrastructure](../../../installing/installing_ibm_z/upi/upi-ibm-z-preparing-to-install.xml#upi-ibm-z-preparing-to-install).

- You reviewed details about the [OpenShift Container Platform installation and update](../../../architecture/architecture-installation.xml#architecture-installation) processes.

- You read the documentation on [selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users](../../../installing/overview/installing-preparing.xml#installing-preparing).

- You [mirrored the images for a disconnected installation](../../../disconnected/installing-mirroring-installation-images.xml#installing-mirroring-installation-images) to your registry and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of OpenShift Container Platform.

- You must move or remove any existing installation files, before you begin the installation process. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Ensure that installation steps are done from a machine with access to the installation media.

- You provisioned [persistent storage using OpenShift Data Foundation](../../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-ocs.xml#persistent-storage-ocs) or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with `ReadWriteMany` access.

- If you use a firewall, you [configured it to allow the sites](../../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.xml#configuring-firewall) that your cluster requires access to.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.

- You provisioned a RHEL Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) system that is hosted on the logical partition (LPAR) and based on RHEL 8.6 or later. See [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#RHEL8_and_9_Life_Cycle).

# About installations in restricted networks

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, you can perform an installation that does not require an active connection to the internet to obtain software components. Restricted network installations can be completed using installer-provisioned infrastructure or user-provisioned infrastructure, depending on the cloud platform to which you are installing the cluster.

If you choose to perform a restricted network installation on a cloud platform, you still require access to its cloud APIs. Some cloud functions, like Amazon Web Service’s Route 53 DNS and IAM services, require internet access. Depending on your network, you might require less internet access for an installation on bare metal hardware, Nutanix, or on VMware vSphere.

To complete a restricted network installation, you must create a registry that mirrors the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contains the installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your closed network, or by using other methods that meet your restrictions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because of the complexity of the configuration for user-provisioned installations, consider completing a standard user-provisioned infrastructure installation before you attempt a restricted network installation using user-provisioned infrastructure. Completing this test installation might make it easier to isolate and troubleshoot any issues that might arise during your installation in a restricted network.

## Additional limits

Clusters in restricted networks have the following additional limitations and restrictions:

- The `ClusterVersion` status includes an `Unable to retrieve available updates` error.

- By default, you cannot use the contents of the Developer Catalog because you cannot access the required image stream tags.

# Preparing the user-provisioned infrastructure

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To ensure a successful deployment and meet cluster requirements in OpenShift Container Platform, prepare your user-provisioned infrastructure before starting the installation. Configuring your compute, network, and storage components in advance provides the stable foundation necessary for the installation program to function correctly.

</div>

This section provides details about the high-level steps required to set up your cluster infrastructure in preparation for an OpenShift Container Platform installation. This includes configuring IP networking and network connectivity for your cluster nodes, enabling the required ports through your firewall, and setting up the required DNS and load balancing infrastructure.

After preparation, your cluster infrastructure must meet the requirements outlined in the *Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure* section.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have reviewed the [OpenShift Container Platform 4.x Tested Integrations](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4128421) page.

- You have reviewed the infrastructure requirements detailed in the *Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure* section.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  If you are using DHCP to provide the IP networking configuration to your cluster nodes, configure your DHCP service.

    1.  Add persistent IP addresses for the nodes to your DHCP server configuration. In your configuration, match the MAC address of the relevant network interface to the intended IP address for each node.

    2.  When you use DHCP to configure IP addressing for the cluster machines, the machines also obtain the DNS server information through DHCP. Define the persistent DNS server address that is used by the cluster nodes through your DHCP server configuration.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you are not using a DHCP service, you must provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at RHCOS install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the *Installing RHCOS and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process* section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options.

    3.  Define the hostnames of your cluster nodes in your DHCP server configuration. See the *Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP* section for details about hostname considerations.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you are not using a DHCP service, the cluster nodes obtain their hostname through a reverse DNS lookup.

2.  Choose to perform either a fast track installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) or a full installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). For the full installation, you must set up an HTTP or HTTPS server to provide Ignition files and install images to the cluster nodes. For the fast track installation an HTTP or HTTPS server is not required, however, a DHCP server is required. See sections “Fast-track installation: Creating Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines" and “Full installation: Creating Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines".

3.  Ensure that your network infrastructure provides the required network connectivity between the cluster components. See the *Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for details about the requirements.

4.  Configure your firewall to enable the ports required for the OpenShift Container Platform cluster components to communicate. See *Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for details about the ports that are required.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > By default, port `1936` is accessible for an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, because each control plane node needs access to this port.
    >
    > For ingress health check probes, the `/healthz/ready` endpoint is available on this port.
    >
    > Avoid using the Ingress load balancer to expose this port, because doing so might result in the exposure of sensitive information, such as statistics and metrics, related to Ingress Controllers.

5.  Setup the required DNS infrastructure for your cluster.

    1.  Configure DNS name resolution for the Kubernetes API, the application wildcard, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

    2.  Configure reverse DNS resolution for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

        See the *User-provisioned DNS requirements* section for more information about the OpenShift Container Platform DNS requirements.

6.  Validate your DNS configuration.

    1.  From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses in the responses correspond to the correct components.

    2.  From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names in the responses correspond to the correct components.

        See the *Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for detailed DNS validation steps.

7.  Provision the required API and application ingress load balancing infrastructure. See the *Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for more information about the requirements.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some load balancing solutions require the DNS name resolution for the cluster nodes to be in place before the load balancing is initialized.

</div>

## Example load balancer configuration for user-provisioned clusters

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Reference the example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration so that you can understand how to meet the load balancing requirements for user-provisioned clusters.

</div>

The sample is an `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.

> [!TIP]
> If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the `haproxy` process is listening on ports `6443`, `22623`, `443`, and `80` by running `netstat -nltupe` on the HAProxy node.

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to `enforcing`, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running `setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1`.

where:

`listen api-server-6443`
Port `6443` handles the Kubernetes API traffic and points to the control plane machines.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.

# Manually creating the installation configuration file

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To customise your OpenShift Container Platform deployment and meet specific network requirements, manually create the installation configuration file. This ensures that the installation program uses your tailored settings rather than default values during the setup process.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have an SSH public key on your local machine for use with the installation program. You can use the key for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery.

- You have obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:

    ``` terminal
    $ mkdir <installation_directory>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must create a directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.

2.  Customize the provided sample `install-config.yaml` file template and save the file in the `<installation_directory>`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must name this configuration file `install-config.yaml`.

3.  Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install many clusters.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Back up the `install-config.yaml` file now, because the installation process consumes the file in the next step.

```

where:

`baseDomain`
Specifies the base domain of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this base and include the cluster name.

`compute`
Specifies the `compute` node configurations, which is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`.

`controlPlane`
Specifies the `controlPlane` node configurations, which is a single mapping. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.

`hyperthreading`
Specifies whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading. By default, SMT is enabled to increase the performance of the cores in your machines. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable SMT, you must disable it in all cluster machines; this includes both control plane and compute machines.

> [!NOTE]
> Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is enabled by default. If SMT is not available on your OpenShift Container Platform nodes, the `hyperthreading` parameter has no effect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you disable `hyperthreading`, whether on your OpenShift Container Platform nodes or in the `install-config.yaml` file, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.

`compute.replicas`
Specifies the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you on installer-provisioned installations. You must set this value to `0` when you install OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure. Additionally for user-provisioned installations, you must manually deploy the compute machines before you finish installing the cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are installing a three-node cluster, do not deploy any compute machines when you install the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines.

`controlPlane.replicas`
Specifies the number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because the cluster uses these values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy.

`metadata.name`
Specifies the cluster name that you specified in your DNS records.

`clusterNetwork.cidr`
Specifies a block of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. These IP addresses are used for the pod network. If you need to access the pods from an external network, you must configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

> [!NOTE]
> Class E CIDR range is reserved for a future use. To use the Class E CIDR range, you must ensure your networking environment accepts the IP addresses within the Class E CIDR range.

`cidr.hostPrefix`
Specifies the subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if `hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node is assigned a `/23` subnet out of the given `cidr`, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses. If you are required to provide access to nodes from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

`networkType`
Specifies the cluster network plugin to install. The default value `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported value.

`serviceNetwork`
Specifies the IP address pool to use for service IP addresses. You can enter only one IP address pool. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. If you need to access the services from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

`platform`
Specifies the platform. You must set the platform to `none`. You cannot provide additional platform configuration variables for IBM Z® infrastructure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clusters that are installed with the platform type `none` are unable to use some features, such as managing compute machines with the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that would normally support the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation.

`fips`
Specifies either enabling or disabling FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see [Switching RHEL to FIPS mode](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/switching-rhel-to-fips-mode_security-hardening).
>
> When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

`pullSecret`
Specifies the registry domain name for `<local_registry>`, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example, `registry.example.com` or `registry.example.com:5000`. For `<credentials>`, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry.

`sshKey`
Specifies the SSH public key for the `core` user in Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS).

> [!NOTE]
> For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.

`additionalTrustBundle`
Specifies the `additionalTrustBundle` parameter and value. The value must be the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry. The certificate file can be an existing, trusted certificate authority or the self-signed certificate that you generated for the mirror registry.

`imageContentSources`
Specifies the `imageContentSources` section according to the output of the command that you used to mirror the repository.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - When using the `oc adm release mirror` command, use the output from the `imageContentSources` section.
>
> - When using `oc mirror` command, use the `repositoryDigestMirrors` section of the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file that results from running the command.
>
> - `ImageContentSourcePolicy` is deprecated. For more information see *Configuring image registry repository mirroring*.

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To enable internet access in environments that deny direct connections, configure a cluster-wide proxy in the `install-config.yaml` file. This configuration ensures that the new OpenShift Container Platform cluster routes traffic through the specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

- You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object’s `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is populated with the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration.
  >
  > For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    baseDomain: my.domain.com
    proxy:
      httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
      httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
      noProxy: example.com
    additionalTrustBundle: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `proxy.httpProxy`
    Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`.

    `proxy.httpsProxy`
    Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.

    `proxy.noProxy`
    Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations.

    `additionalTrustBundle`
    If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named `user-ca-bundle` in the `openshift-config` namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you provide `additionalTrustBundle` and at least one proxy setting, the `Proxy` object is configured to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a `trusted-ca-bundle` config map that merges the contents specified for the `trustedCA` parameter with the RHCOS trust bundle. The `additionalTrustBundle` field is required unless the proxy’s identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.

    `additionalTrustBundlePolicy`
    Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the `Proxy` object to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The allowed values are `Proxyonly` and `Always`. Use `Proxyonly` to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map only when `http/https` proxy is configured. Use `Always` to always reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map. The default value is `Proxyonly`. Optional parameter.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the installation program times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installation program. For example:
    >
    > ``` terminal
    > $ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
    > ```

2.  Save the file and reference it when installing OpenShift Container Platform.

    The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named `cluster` that uses the proxy settings in the provided `install-config.yaml` file. If no proxy settings are provided, a `cluster` `Proxy` object is still created, but it will have a nil `spec`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.

</div>

## Configuring a three-node cluster

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To create smaller, resource-efficient clusters for testing and production, deploy a bare-metal cluster with zero compute machines in a minimal three-node cluster. This optional configuration uses only three control plane machines, optimizing infrastructure resources for testing, development, and production purposes.

</div>

In three-node OpenShift Container Platform environments, the three control plane machines are schedulable, which means that your application workloads are scheduled to run on them.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- Ensure that the number of compute replicas is set to `0` in your `install-config.yaml` file, as shown in the following `compute` stanza:

  ``` yaml
  compute:
  - name: worker
    platform: {}
    replicas: 0
  # ...
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > You must set the value of the `replicas` parameter for the compute machines to `0` when you install OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure, regardless of the number of compute machines you are deploying. In installer-provisioned installations, the parameter controls the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you. This does not apply to user-provisioned installations, where the compute machines are deployed manually.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The preferred resource for control plane nodes is six vCPUs and 21 GB. For three control plane nodes this is the memory + vCPU equivalent of a minimum five-node cluster. You should back the three nodes, each installed on a 120 GB disk, with three IFLs that are SMT2 enabled. The minimum tested setup is three vCPUs and 10 GB on a 120 GB disk for each control plane node.

</div>

For three-node cluster installations, follow these next steps:

- If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes. See the *Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure* section for more information.

- When you create the Kubernetes manifest files in the following procedure, ensure that the `mastersSchedulable` parameter in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` file is set to `true`. This enables your application workloads to run on the control plane nodes.

- Do not deploy any compute nodes when you create the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines.

To manage cluster networking, configure the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) `Network` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` so the cluster uses the correct IP ranges and network plugin settings for reliable pod and service connectivity. Some settings and fields are inherited at the time of install or by the `default.Network.type` plugin, OVN-Kubernetes.

</div>

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the `Network` API in the `Network.config.openshift.io` API group:

`clusterNetwork`
IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.

`serviceNetwork`
IP address pool for services.

`defaultNetwork.type`
Cluster network plugin. `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported plugin during installation.

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the `defaultNetwork` object in the CNO object named `cluster`.

## Cluster Network Operator configuration object

The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:

> For a cluster that needs to deploy objects across multiple networks, ensure that you specify the same value for the `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter for each network type that is defined in the `install-config.yaml` file. Setting a different value for each `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter can impact the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, where the plugin cannot effectively route object traffic among different nodes.

# Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To customize cluster definitions and manually start machines, generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files. These assets provide the necessary instructions to configure the cluster infrastructure according to your specific deployment requirements.

</div>

The installation configuration file transforms into the Kubernetes manifests. The manifests wrap into the Ignition configuration files, which are later used to configure the cluster machines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The Ignition config files that the OpenShift Container Platform installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for *Recovering from expired control plane certificates* for more information.
>
> - It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

> [!NOTE]
> The installation program that generates the manifest and Ignition files is architecture specific and can be obtained from the [client image mirror](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/s390x/clients/ocp/latest/). The Linux version of the installation program runs on s390x only. This installer program is also available as a macOS version.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program. For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.

- You created the `install-config.yaml` installation configuration file.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Change to the directory that contains the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
    ```

    where

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specifies the installation directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file you created.

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you are installing a three-node cluster, skip the following step to allow the control plane nodes to be schedulable.

    \+

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you configure control plane nodes from the default unschedulable to schedulable, additional subscriptions are required. This is because control plane nodes then become compute nodes.

2.  Check that the `mastersSchedulable` parameter in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` Kubernetes manifest file is set to `false`. This setting prevents pods from being scheduled on the control plane machines:

    1.  Open the `<installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` file.

    2.  Locate the `mastersSchedulable` parameter and ensure that it is set to `false`.

    3.  Save and exit the file.

3.  To create the Ignition configuration files, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir <installation_directory>
    ```

    where:

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specifies the same installation directory.

    Ignition config files are created for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes in the installation directory. The `kubeadmin-password` and `kubeconfig` files are created in the `./<installation_directory>/auth` directory:

        .
        ├── auth
        │   ├── kubeadmin-password
        │   └── kubeconfig
        ├── bootstrap.ign

# Installing RHCOS and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process

To install OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z® infrastructure that you provision, you must install Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) guest virtual machines. When you install RHCOS, you must provide the Ignition config file that was generated by the OpenShift Container Platform installation program for the type of machine you are installing. If you have configured suitable networking, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure, the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process begins automatically after the RHCOS machines have rebooted.

You can perform a fast-track installation of RHCOS that uses a prepackaged QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW2) disk image. Alternatively, you can perform a full installation on a new QCOW2 disk image.

To add further security to your system, you can optionally install RHCOS using IBM® Secure Execution before proceeding to the fast-track installation.

## Configuring encryption for nodes in an IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE environment

You can choose between three methods to optionally secure your OpenShift Container Platform control plane and compute nodes on IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE:

- IBM® Secure Execution

- Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) encryption via IBM® Crypto Express (CEX)

- Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE)

### Installing RHCOS using IBM Secure Execution

Before you install RHCOS using IBM® Secure Execution, you must prepare the underlying infrastructure.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- IBM® z15 or later, or IBM® LinuxONE III or later.

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 or later.

- You have a bootstrap Ignition file. The file is not protected, enabling others to view and edit it.

- You have verified that the boot image has not been altered after installation.

- You must run all your nodes as IBM® Secure Execution guests.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Prepare your RHEL KVM host to support IBM® Secure Execution.

    - By default, KVM hosts do not support guests in IBM® Secure Execution mode. To support guests in IBM® Secure Execution mode, KVM hosts must boot in LPAR mode with the kernel parameter specification `prot_virt=1`. To enable `prot_virt=1` on RHEL 8, follow these steps:

      1.  Navigate to `/boot/loader/entries/` to modify your bootloader configuration file `*.conf`.

      2.  Add the kernel command line parameter `prot_virt=1`.

      3.  Run the `zipl` command and reboot your system.

          KVM hosts that successfully start with support for IBM® Secure Execution for Linux issue the following kernel message:

          ``` terminal
          prot_virt: Reserving <amount>MB as ultravisor base storage.
          ```

      4.  To verify that the KVM host now supports IBM® Secure Execution, run the following command:

          ``` terminal
          # cat /sys/firmware/uv/prot_virt_host
          ```

          <div class="formalpara">

          <div class="title">

          Example output

          </div>

          ``` terminal
          1
          ```

          </div>

          The value of this attribute is 1 for Linux instances that detect their environment as consistent with that of a secure host. For other instances, the value is 0.

2.  Add your host keys to the KVM guest via Ignition.

    During the first boot, RHCOS looks for your host keys to re-encrypt itself with them. RHCOS searches for files starting with `ibm-z-hostkey-` in the `/etc/se-hostkeys` directory. All host keys, for each machine the cluster is running on, must be loaded into the directory by the administrator. After first boot, you cannot run the VM on any other machines.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You need to prepare your Ignition file on a safe system. For example, another IBM® Secure Execution guest.

    For example:

    ```` terminal
    {
      "ignition": { "version": "3.0.0" },
      "storage": {
        "files": [
          {
            "path": "/etc/se-hostkeys/ibm-z-hostkey-<your-hostkey>.crt",
            "contents": {
              "source": "data:;base64,<base64 encoded hostkey document>"
            },
            "mode": 420
          },
          {
            "path": "/etc/se-hostkeys/ibm-z-hostkey-<your-hostkey>.crt",
            "contents": {
              "source": "data:;base64,<base64 encoded hostkey document>"
            },
            "mode": 420
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    ````

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can add as many host keys as required if you want your node to be able to run on multiple IBM Z® machines.

3.  To generate the Base64 encoded string, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    base64 <your-hostkey>.crt
    ```

    Compared to guests not running IBM® Secure Execution, the first boot of the machine is longer because the entire image is encrypted with a randomly generated LUKS passphrase before the Ignition phase.

4.  Add Ignition protection

    To protect the secrets that are stored in the Ignition config file from being read or even modified, you must encrypt the Ignition config file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To achieve the desired security, Ignition logging and local login are disabled by default when running IBM® Secure Execution.

    1.  Fetch the public GPG key for the `secex-qemu.qcow2` image and encrypt the Ignition config with the key by running the following command:

        ``` terminal
        gpg --recipient-file /path/to/ignition.gpg.pub --yes --output /path/to/config.ign.gpg --verbose --armor --encrypt /path/to/config.ign
        ```

5.  Follow the fast-track installation of RHCOS to install nodes by using the IBM® Secure Execution QCOW image.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Before you start the VM, replace `serial=ignition` with `serial=ignition_crypted`, and add the `launchSecurity` parameter.

</div>

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

When you have completed the fast-track installation of RHCOS and Ignition runs at the first boot, verify if decryption is successful.

</div>

- If the decryption is successful, you can expect an output similar to the following example:

  <div class="formalpara">

  <div class="title">

  Example output

### LUKS encryption via CEX in an IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE environment

Enabling hardware-based Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) encryption via IBM® Crypto Express (CEX) in an IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE environment requires additional steps, which are described in detail in this section.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have installed the `butane` utility.

- You have reviewed the instructions for how to create machine configs with Butane.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create Butane configuration files for the control plane and compute nodes:

    - Create a file named `main-storage.bu` by using the following Butane configuration for a control plane node with disk encryption, for example:

      ``` yaml
      variant: openshift
      version: 4.17.0
      metadata:
        name: main-storage
        labels:
          machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
      boot_device:
        layout: s390x-virt
        luks:
          cex:
            enabled: true
      openshift:
        fips: true
        kernel_arguments:
          - rd.luks.key=/etc/luks/cex.key
      ```

      - Specifies whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

      - Specifies the location of the key that is required to decrypt the device. You can not change this value.

2.  Create a parameter file that includes `ignition.platform.id=metal` and `ignition.firstboot`.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example kernel parameter file for the control plane machine

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    cio_ignore=all,!condev rd.neednet=1 \
    console=ttysclp0 \
    ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal \
    coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<http_server>/master.ign \
    coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<http_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img \
    ip=<ip_address>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname>::none nameserver=<dns> \
    rd.znet=qeth,0.0.bdd0,0.0.bdd1,0.0.bdd2,layer2=1 \
    rd.zfcp=0.0.5677,0x600606680g7f0056,0x034F000000000000
    ```

    </div>

    - Specifies the location of the Ignition configuration file. Use `master.ign` or `worker.ign`. You can only use the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

    - Specifies the location of the `rootfs` artifact for the `kernel` and `initramfs` that you want to boot. You can only use the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Write all options in the parameter file as a single line and make sure you have no newline characters.

### Configuring NBDE with static IP in an IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE environment

Enabling NBDE disk encryption in an IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE environment requires additional steps, which are described in detail in this section.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have set up the External Tang Server. See [Network-bound disk encryption](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption_security-hardening#network-bound-disk-encryption_configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption) for instructions.

- You have installed the `butane` utility.

- You have reviewed the instructions for how to create machine configs with Butane.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create Butane configuration files for the control plane and compute nodes.

    The following example of a Butane configuration for a control plane node creates a file named `master-storage.bu` for disk encryption:

    ``` yaml
    variant: openshift
    version: 4.17.0
    metadata:
      name: master-storage
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
    storage:
      luks:
        - clevis:
            tang:
              - thumbprint: QcPr_NHFJammnRCA3fFMVdNBwjs
                url: http://clevis.example.com:7500
          device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/root
          label: luks-root
          name: root
          wipe_volume: true
      filesystems:
        - device: /dev/mapper/root
          format: xfs
          label: root
          wipe_filesystem: true
    openshift:
      fips: true
    ```

    - Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

2.  Create a customized initramfs file to boot the machine, by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ coreos-installer pxe customize \
        /root/rhcos-bootfiles/rhcos-<release>-live-initramfs.s390x.img \
        --dest-device /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-<serial_number> --dest-karg-append \
        ip=<ip_address>::<gateway_ip>:<subnet_mask>::<network_device>:none \
        --dest-karg-append nameserver=<nameserver_ip> \
        --dest-karg-append rd.neednet=1 -o \
        /root/rhcos-bootfiles/<node_name>-initramfs.s390x.img
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Before first boot, you must customize the initramfs for each node in the cluster, and add PXE kernel parameters.

3.  Create a parameter file that includes `ignition.platform.id=metal` and `ignition.firstboot`.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example kernel parameter file for the control plane machine

    </div>

## Networking options for ISO installations

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can configure advanced options so that you can modify the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) manual installation process. The subsequent sections show examples of networking options for an ISO installation.

</div>

If you install RHCOS from an ISO image, you can add kernel arguments manually when you boot the image to configure networking for a node. If no networking arguments are specified, DHCP is activated in the initramfs when RHCOS detects that networking is required to fetch the Ignition config file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When adding networking arguments manually, you must also add the `rd.neednet=1` kernel argument to bring the network up in the initramfs.

The following information provides examples for configuring networking on your RHCOS nodes for ISO installations. The examples describe how to use the `ip=` and `nameserver=` kernel arguments.

> [!NOTE]
> Ordering is important when adding the kernel arguments: `ip=` and `nameserver=`.

The networking options are passed to the `dracut` tool during system boot. For more information about the networking options supported by `dracut`, see the `dracut.cmdline` manual page.

### Configuring DHCP or static IP addresses

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can configure an IP address by using either DHCP or an individual static IP address. If you set a static IP, you must then identify the DNS server IP address on each node.

</div>

The configuration examples in the procedure, update the IP addresses for the following components:

- The node’s IP address to `10.10.10.2`

- The gateway address to `10.10.10.254`

- The netmask to `255.255.255.0`

- The hostname to `core0.example.com`

- The DNS server address to `4.4.4.41`

- The auto-configuration value to `none`. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Enter a command like the following command to configure a static IP address:

    ``` terminal
    ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
    nameserver=4.4.4.41
    ```

2.  Enter a command like the following command to configure a DHCP IP address:

    ``` terminal
    ip=enp1s0:dhcp
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you use DHCP to configure IP addressing for the RHCOS machines, the machines also obtain the DNS server information through DHCP. For DHCP-based deployments, you can define the DNS server address that is used by the RHCOS nodes through your DHCP server configuration.

3.  If two or more network interfaces and only one interface exists, disable DHCP on a single interface. In the example, the `enp1s0` interface has a static networking configuration and DHCP is disabled for `enp2s0`, which is not used:

    ``` terminal
    ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
    ip=::::core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
    ```

4.  If you need to combine DHCP and static IP configurations on systems with multiple network interfaces, run the following example command:

    ``` terminal
    ip=enp1s0:dhcp
    ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
    ```

</div>

### Configuring an IP address without a static hostname

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can configure an IP address without assigning a static hostname. If a static hostname is not set by the user, the static hostname gets picked up and automatically set by a reverse DNS lookup.

</div>

The configuration examples in the procedure, update the IP addresses for the following components:

- The node’s IP address to `10.10.10.2`

- The gateway address to `10.10.10.254`

- The netmask to `255.255.255.0`

- The DNS server address to `4.4.4.41`

- The auto-configuration value to `none`. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To configure an IP address without a static hostname, enter a command like the following command:

  ``` terminal
  ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0::enp1s0:none
  nameserver=4.4.4.41
  ```

</div>

### Specifying multiple network interfaces and DNS servers

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can specify multiple network interfaces by setting multiple `ip=` entries. You can provide multiple DNS servers by adding a `nameserver=` entry for each server,

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To specify multiple network interfaces for your interfaces, you can enter a command like the following command:

  ``` terminal
  ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
  ip=10.10.10.3::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
  ```

- To provide multiple DNS servers by adding a `nameserver=` entry for each server, enter a command like the following command:

  ``` terminal
  nameserver=1.1.1.1
  nameserver=8.8.8.8
  ```

</div>

### Configuring default gateway and route

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

As an optional task, you can configure routes to additional networks by setting an `rd.route=` value.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> When you configure one or multiple networks, one default gateway is required. If the additional network gateway is different from the primary network gateway, the default gateway must be the primary network gateway.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To configure the default gateway, enter the following command:

  ``` terminal
  ip=::10.10.10.254::::
  ```

- To configure the route for an additional network, enter the following command:

  ``` terminal
  rd.route=20.20.20.0/24:20.20.20.254:enp2s0
  ```

</div>

### Configuring VLANs on individual interfaces

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

As an optional task, you can configure VLANs on individual interfaces by using the `vlan=` parameter.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To configure a VLAN on a network interface and use a static IP address, run the following command:

  ``` terminal
  ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0.100:none
  vlan=enp2s0.100:enp2s0
  ```

- To configure a VLAN on a network interface and to use DHCP, run the following command:

  ``` terminal
  ip=enp2s0.100:dhcp
  vlan=enp2s0.100:enp2s0
  ```

</div>

# Waiting for the bootstrap process to complete

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To install OpenShift Container Platform, use Ignition configuration files to initialize the bootstrap process after the cluster nodes boot into RHCOS. You must wait for this process to complete to ensure the cluster is fully installed.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have created the Ignition config files for your cluster.

- You have configured suitable network, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure.

- You have obtained the installation program and generated the Ignition config files for your cluster.

- You installed RHCOS on your cluster machines and provided the Ignition config files that the OpenShift Container Platform installation program generated.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Monitor the bootstrap process:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for bootstrap-complete \
        --log-level=info
    ```

    where:

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files.

    `--log-level=info`
    Specifies `warn`, `debug`, or `error` instead of `info` to view different installation details.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.test.example.com:6443...
    INFO API v1.34.2 up
    INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for bootstrapping to complete...
    INFO It is now safe to remove the bootstrap resources
    ```

    </div>

    The command succeeds when the Kubernetes API server signals that it has been bootstrapped on the control plane machines.

2.  After the bootstrap process is complete, remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer at this point. You can also remove or reformat the bootstrap machine itself.

</div>

# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To log in to your cluster as the default system user, export the `kubeconfig` file. This configuration enables the CLI to authenticate and connect to the specific API server created during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

</div>

The `kubeconfig` file is specific to a cluster and is created during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You deployed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

- You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Export the `kubeadmin` credentials by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
    ```

    where:

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files.

2.  Verify you can run `oc` commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command:

    ``` terminal

# Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To add machines to a cluster, verify the status of the certificate signing requests (CSRs) generated for each machine. If manual approval is required, approve the client requests first, followed by the server requests.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You added machines to your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get nodes
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
    master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.34.2
    master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.34.2
    master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.34.2
    ```

    </div>

    The output lists all of the machines that you created.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.

2.  Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
    csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
    csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
    ...
    ```

    </div>

    In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.

3.  If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

    > [!NOTE]
    > Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the `machine-approver` if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups, and confirm the identity of the node.

    - To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
      ```

      where:

      `<csr_name>`
      Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

    - To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.

4.  Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
    csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
    csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
    ...
    ```

    </div>

5.  If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

    - To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
      ```

      where:

      `<csr_name>`
      Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

    - To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
      ```

6.  After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get nodes
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION

    worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.34.2
    worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.34.2
    ```

    </div>

    > [!NOTE]
    > It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the `Ready` status.

2.  Configure the Operators that are not available.

</div>

## Disabling the default software catalog sources

Operator catalogs that source content provided by Red Hat and community projects are configured for the software catalog by default during an OpenShift Container Platform installation. In a restricted network environment, you must disable the default catalogs as a cluster administrator.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- Disable the sources for the default catalogs by adding `disableAllDefaultSources: true` to the `OperatorHub` object:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
      -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
  ```

</div>

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the **Administration** → **Cluster Settings** → **Configuration** → **OperatorHub** page, click the **Sources** tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources.

## Image registry storage configuration

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

The Image Registry Operator is not initially available for platforms that do not provide default storage. After installation, you must configure your registry to use storage so that the Registry Operator is made available.

</div>

Configure a persistent volume, which is required for production clusters. Where applicable, you can configure an empty directory as the storage location for non-production clusters.

You can also allow the image registry to use block storage types by using the `Recreate` rollout strategy during upgrades.

### Configuring registry storage for IBM Z

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To ensure the registry is fully operational, configure the registry to use storage immediately after the cluster installation. This configuration is a mandatory step to enable the registry to store data.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have a cluster on IBM Z®.

- You have provisioned persistent storage for your cluster, such as Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > OpenShift Container Platform supports `ReadWriteOnce` access for image registry storage when you have only one replica. `ReadWriteOnce` access also requires that the registry uses the `Recreate` rollout strategy. To deploy an image registry that supports high availability with two or more replicas, `ReadWriteMany` access is required.

- You must have a system with at least 100Gi capacity.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  To configure your registry to use storage, change the `spec.storage.pvc` in the `configs.imageregistry/cluster` resource.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you use shared storage, review your security settings to prevent outside access.

2.  Verify that you do not have a registry pod:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get pod -n openshift-image-registry -l docker-registry=default
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    > If you do have a registry pod in your output, you do not need to continue with this procedure.

3.  Check the registry configuration:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

5.  Ensure that your registry is set to managed to enable building and pushing of images.

    - Run:

          $ oc edit configs.imageregistry/cluster

      Then, change the line

### Configuring storage for the image registry in non-production clusters

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You must configure storage for the Image Registry Operator. For non-production clusters, you can set the image registry to an empty directory. If you do so, all images are lost if you restart the registry.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To set the image registry storage to an empty directory:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
  ```

  > [!WARNING]
  > Configure this option only for non-production clusters.

  If you run this command before the Image Registry Operator initializes its components, the `oc patch` command fails with the following error:

  ``` terminal
  Error from server (NotFound): configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io "cluster" not found
  ```

  Wait a few minutes and run the command again.

    Alternatively, the following command notifies you when all of the clusters are available. The command also retrieves and displays credentials:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for install-complete
    ```

    where:

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specifies the path to the directory that you stored the installation files in.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster to initialize...
    ```

    </div>

    The command succeeds when the Cluster Version Operator finishes deploying the OpenShift Container Platform cluster from Kubernetes API server.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > - The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for *Recovering from expired control plane certificates* for more information.
    >
    > - It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

2.  Confirm that the Kubernetes API server is communicating with the pods.

    1.  To view a list of all pods, use the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get pods --all-namespaces
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

        Example output

        </div>

        ``` terminal
        NAMESPACE                         NAME                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
        openshift-apiserver-operator      openshift-apiserver-operator-85cb746d55-zqhs8   1/1     Running     1          9m
        openshift-apiserver               apiserver-67b9g                                 1/1     Running     0          3m
        openshift-apiserver               apiserver-ljcmx                                 1/1     Running     0          1m
        openshift-apiserver               apiserver-z25h4                                 1/1     Running     0          2m
        openshift-authentication-operator authentication-operator-69d5d8bf84-vh2n8        1/1     Running     0          5m
        ```

        </div>

    2.  View the logs for a pod that is listed in the output of the previous command by using the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>
        ```

        where:

        `<namespace>`
        Specifies the pod name and namespace, as shown in the output of an earlier command.

        If the pod logs display, the Kubernetes API server can communicate with the cluster machines.

3.  For an installation with Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), additional steps are required to enable multipathing. Do not enable multipathing during installation.

    See "Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS" in the *Postinstallation machine configuration tasks* documentation for more information.

4.  Register your cluster on the [Cluster registration](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/register) page.
