After installing OpenShift Container Platform, you can configure additional devices for your cluster in an IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE environment, which is installed with z/VM. The following devices can be configured:

- Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) host

- FCP LUN

- DASD

- qeth

You can configure devices by adding udev rules using the Machine Config Operator (MCO) or you can configure devices manually.

> [!NOTE]
> The procedures described here apply only to z/VM installations. If you have installed your cluster with RHEL KVM on IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE infrastructure, no additional configuration is needed inside the KVM guest after the devices were added to the KVM guests. However, both in z/VM and RHEL KVM environments the next steps to configure the Local Storage Operator and Kubernetes NMState Operator need to be applied.

# Configuring additional devices using the Machine Config Operator (MCO)

Tasks in this section describe how to use features of the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to configure additional devices in an IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE environment. Configuring devices with the MCO is persistent but only allows specific configurations for compute nodes. MCO does not allow control plane nodes to have different configurations.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

- The device must be available to the z/VM guest.

- The device is already attached.

- The device is not included in the `cio_ignore` list, which can be set in the kernel parameters.

- You have created a `MachineConfig` object file with the following YAML:

  ``` yaml
  apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
  kind: MachineConfigPool
  metadata:
    name: worker0
  spec:
    machineConfigSelector:
      matchExpressions:
        - {key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker,worker0]}
    nodeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/worker0: ""
  ```

</div>

## Configuring a Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) host

The following is an example of how to configure an FCP host adapter with N_Port Identifier Virtualization (NPIV) by adding a udev rule.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Take the following sample udev rule `441-zfcp-host-0.0.8000.rules`:

    ``` terminal
    ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="ccw", KERNEL=="0.0.8000", DRIVER=="zfcp", GOTO="cfg_zfcp_host_0.0.8000"
    ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="drivers", KERNEL=="zfcp", TEST=="[ccw/0.0.8000]", GOTO="cfg_zfcp_host_0.0.8000"
    GOTO="end_zfcp_host_0.0.8000"

    LABEL="cfg_zfcp_host_0.0.8000"
    ATTR{[ccw/0.0.8000]online}="1"

    LABEL="end_zfcp_host_0.0.8000"
    ```

2.  Convert the rule to Base64 encoded by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ base64 /path/to/file/
    ```

3.  Copy the following MCO sample profile into a YAML file:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
       labels:
         machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker0
       name: 99-worker0-devices
    spec:
       config:
         ignition:
           version: 3.2.0
         storage:
           files:
           - contents:
               source: data:text/plain;base64,<encoded_base64_string>
             filesystem: root
             mode: 420
             path: /etc/udev/rules.d/41-zfcp-host-0.0.8000.rules
    ```

# Configuring additional devices manually

Tasks in this section describe how to manually configure additional devices in an IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE environment. This configuration method is persistent over node restarts but not OpenShift Container Platform native and you need to redo the steps if you replace the node.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

- The device must be available to the node.

- In a z/VM environment, the device must be attached to the z/VM guest.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Connect to the node via SSH by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ ssh <user>@<node_ip_address>
    ```

    You can also start a debug session to the node by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc debug node/<node_name>
    ```

2.  To enable the devices with the `chzdev` command, enter the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ sudo chzdev -e <device>
    ```

# RoCE network Cards

RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) network cards do not need to be enabled and their interfaces can be configured with the Kubernetes NMState Operator whenever they are available in the node. For example, RoCE network cards are available if they are attached in a z/VM environment or passed through in a RHEL KVM environment.

# Enabling multipathing for FCP LUNs

Tasks in this section describe how to manually configure additional devices in an IBM Z® or IBM® LinuxONE environment. This configuration method is persistent over node restarts but not OpenShift Container Platform native and you need to redo the steps if you replace the node.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On IBM Z® and IBM® LinuxONE, you can enable multipathing only if you configured your cluster for it during installation. For more information, see "Installing RHCOS and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process" in *Installing a cluster with z/VM on IBM Z® and IBM® LinuxONE*.
