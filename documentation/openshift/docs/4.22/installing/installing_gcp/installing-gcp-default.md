<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.17, you can install a cluster on Google Cloud that uses the default configuration options.

</div>

# Prerequisites

- You reviewed details about the [OpenShift Container Platform installation and update](../../architecture/architecture-installation.xml#architecture-installation) processes.

- You read the documentation on [selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users](../../installing/overview/installing-preparing.xml#installing-preparing).

- You [configured a Google Cloud project](../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.xml#installing-gcp-account) to host the cluster.

- If you use a firewall, you [configured it to allow the sites](../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.xml#configuring-firewall) that your cluster requires access to.

- If you are installing using a [Private Service Connect (PSC) endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect), you must configure the endpoint in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) where you install the cluster, specified in the `install-config.yaml` file, as described in [Installing a cluster on Google Cloud into an existing VPC](../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-vpc.xml#installing-gcp-vpc).

# Internet access for OpenShift Container Platform

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, you require access to the internet to install your cluster.

</div>

You must have internet access to perform the following actions:

- Access [OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift) to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.

- Access [Quay.io](http://quay.io) to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.

- Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your cluster cannot have direct internet access, you can perform a restricted network installation on some types of infrastructure that you provision. During that process, you download the required content and use it to populate a mirror registry with the installation packages. With some installation types, the environment that you install your cluster in will not require internet access. Before you update the cluster, you update the content of the mirror registry.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To enable secure, passwordless SSH access to your cluster nodes, provide an SSH public key during the OpenShift Container Platform installation. This ensures that the installation program automatically configures the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes for remote authentication through the `core` user.

</div>

The SSH public key gets added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list for the `core` user on each node. After the key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user `core`. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The `./openshift-install gather` command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name>
    ```

    Specifies the path and file name, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your `~/.ssh` directory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you plan to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures, do not create a key that uses the `ed25519` algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the `rsa` or `ecdsa` algorithm.

2.  View the public SSH key:

    ``` terminal
    $ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
    ```

    For example, run the following to view the `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` public key:

    ``` terminal
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

3.  Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the `./openshift-install gather` command.

    > [!NOTE]
    > On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_dsa` are managed automatically.

    1.  If the `ssh-agent` process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

        ``` terminal
        $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

        Example output

        </div>

        ``` terminal
        Agent pid 31874
        ```

        </div>

        > [!NOTE]
        > If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.

4.  Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`:

    ``` terminal
    $ ssh-add <path>/<file_name>
    ```

    Specifies the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
    ```

    </div>

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Next steps

</div>

- When you install OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

</div>

# Obtaining the installation program

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on the host you are using for installation.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Go to the [Cluster Type](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install) page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also [download the binaries for a specific OpenShift Container Platform release](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/).

2.  Select your infrastructure provider from the **Run it yourself** section of the page.

3.  Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under **OpenShift Installer** and click **Download Installer**.

4.  Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > - The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
    >
    > - Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.

5.  Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
    ```

6.  Download your installation [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret). This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for OpenShift Container Platform components.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/), where you can specify a version of the installation program to download. However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.

</div>

# Deploying the cluster

You can install OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can run the `create cluster` command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.

- You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

- You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Remove any existing Google Cloud credentials that do not use the service account key for the Google Cloud account that you configured for your cluster and that are stored in the following locations:

    - The `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON`, or `GCLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON` environment variables

    - The `~/.gcp/osServiceAccount.json` file

    - The `gcloud cli` default credentials

2.  In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \
        --log-level=info
    ```

    - For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the files that the installation program creates.

    - To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or `error` instead of `info`.

    When specifying the directory:

    - Verify that the directory has the `execute` permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.

    - Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.

3.  Provide values at the prompts:

    1.  Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

        > [!NOTE]
        > For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.

    2.  Select **gcp** as the platform to target.

    3.  If you have not configured the service account key for your Google Cloud account on your host, you must obtain it from Google Cloud and paste the contents of the file or enter the absolute path to the file.

    4.  Select the project ID to provision the cluster in. The default value is specified by the service account that you configured.

    5.  Select the region to deploy the cluster to.

    6.  Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds to the public DNS zone that you created for your cluster.

    7.  Enter a descriptive name for your cluster. If you provide a name that is longer than 6 characters, only the first 6 characters will be used in the infrastructure ID that is generated from the cluster name.

    8.  Paste the [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret).

4.  Optional: You can reduce the number of permissions for the service account that you used to install the cluster.

    - If you assigned the `Owner` role to your service account, you can remove that role and replace it with the `Viewer` role.

    - If you included the `Service Account Key Admin` role, you can remove it.

</div>

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

</div>

- The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user.

- Credential information also outputs to `<installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example output

</div>

``` terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for *Recovering from expired control plane certificates* for more information.
>
> - It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
