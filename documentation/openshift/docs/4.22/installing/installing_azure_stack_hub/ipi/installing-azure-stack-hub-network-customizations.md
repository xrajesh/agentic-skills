In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.17, you can install a cluster with a customized network configuration on infrastructure that the installation program provisions on Azure Stack Hub. By customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> While you can select `azure` when using the installation program to deploy a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure, this option is only supported for the Azure Public Cloud.

# Prerequisites

- You reviewed details about the [OpenShift Container Platform installation and update](../../../architecture/architecture-installation.xml#architecture-installation) processes.

- You read the documentation on [selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users](../../../installing/overview/installing-preparing.xml#installing-preparing).

- You have installed Azure Stack Hub version 2008 or later.

- You [configured an Azure Stack Hub account](../../../installing/installing_azure_stack_hub/installing-azure-stack-hub-account.xml#installing-azure-stack-hub-account) to host the cluster.

- If you use a firewall, you [configured it to allow the sites](../../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.xml#configuring-firewall) that your cluster requires access to.

- You verified that you have approximately 16 GB of local disk space. Installing the cluster requires that you download the RHCOS virtual hard drive (VHD) cluster image and upload it to your Azure Stack Hub environment so that it is accessible during deployment. Decompressing the VHD files requires this amount of local disk space.

# Uploading the RHCOS cluster image

You must download the RHCOS virtual hard disk (VHD) cluster image and upload it to your Azure Stack Hub environment so that it is accessible during deployment.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Generate the Ignition config files for your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Obtain the RHCOS VHD cluster image:

    1.  Export the URL of the RHCOS VHD to an environment variable.

        ``` terminal
        $ export COMPRESSED_VHD_URL=$(openshift-install coreos print-stream-json | jq -r '.architectures.x86_64.artifacts.azurestack.formats."vhd.gz".disk.location')
        ```

    2.  Download the compressed RHCOS VHD file locally.

        ``` terminal
        $ curl -O -L ${COMPRESSED_VHD_URL}
        ```

2.  Decompress the VHD file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The decompressed VHD file is approximately 16 GB, so be sure that your host system has 16 GB of free space available. The VHD file can be deleted once you have uploaded it.

3.  Upload the local VHD to the Azure Stack Hub environment, making sure that the blob is publicly available. For example, you can upload the VHD to a blob using the `az` cli or the web portal.

</div>

# Manually creating the installation configuration file

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To customise your OpenShift Container Platform deployment and meet specific network requirements, manually create the installation configuration file. This ensures that the installation program uses your tailored settings rather than default values during the setup process.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have an SSH public key on your local machine for use with the installation program. You can use the key for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery.

- You have obtained the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:

    ``` terminal
    $ mkdir <installation_directory>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must create a directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.

2.  Customize the provided sample `install-config.yaml` file template and save the file in the `<installation_directory>`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must name this configuration file `install-config.yaml`.

    Make the following modifications:

    1.  Specify the required installation parameters.

    2.  Update the `platform.azure` section to specify the parameters that are specific to Azure Stack Hub.

    3.  Optional: Update one or more of the default configuration parameters to customize the installation.

        For more information about the parameters, see "Installation configuration parameters".

3.  Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use it to install many clusters.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Back up the `install-config.yaml` file now, because the installation process consumes the file in the next step.

## Sample customized install-config.yaml file for Azure Stack Hub

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about your OpenShift Container Platform cluster’s platform or modify the values of the required parameters.

- Required.

- If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.

- The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the `compute` section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Although both sections currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions of OpenShift Container Platform will support defining multiple compute pools during installation. Only one control plane pool is used.

- You can specify the size of the disk to use in GB. Minimum recommendation for control plane nodes is 1024 GB.

- The name of the cluster.

- The cluster network plugin to install. The default value `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported value.

- The Azure Resource Manager endpoint that your Azure Stack Hub operator provides.

- The name of the resource group that contains the DNS zone for your base domain.

- The name of your Azure Stack Hub local region.

- The name of an existing resource group to install your cluster to. If undefined, a new resource group is created for the cluster.

- The URL of a storage blob in the Azure Stack environment that contains an RHCOS VHD.

- The pull secret required to authenticate your cluster.

- Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

- You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

  > [!NOTE]
  > For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.

- If the Azure Stack Hub environment is using an internal Certificate Authority (CA), adding the CA certificate is required.

# Manually manage cloud credentials

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) only supports your cloud provider in manual mode. As a result, you must specify the identity and access management (IAM) secrets for your cloud provider.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
    ```

    where `<installation_directory>` is the directory in which the installation program creates files.

2.  Set a `$RELEASE_IMAGE` variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
    ```

3.  Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc adm release extract \
      --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
      --credentials-requests \
      --included \
      --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \
      --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>
    ```

    - The `--included` parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.

    - Specify the location of the `install-config.yaml` file.

    - Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the `CredentialsRequest` objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

      This command creates a YAML file for each `CredentialsRequest` object.

      <div class="formalpara">

      <div class="title">

      Sample `CredentialsRequest` object

      </div>

      ``` yaml

          roleBindings:
          - role: Contributor
        ...
      ```

      </div>

4.  Create YAML files for secrets in the `openshift-install` manifests directory that you generated previously. The secrets must be stored using the namespace and secret name defined in the `spec.secretRef` for each `CredentialsRequest` object.

Prerequisites

</div>

- Create the `install-config.yaml` file and specify the certificate trust bundle in `.pem` format.

- Create the cluster manifests.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  From the directory in which the installation program creates files, go to the `manifests` directory.

2.  Add `user-ca-bundle` to the `spec.trustedCA.name` field.

    <div class="formalpara">

    ```

    </div>

3.  Optional: Back up the `manifests/ cluster-proxy-01-config.yaml` file. The installation program consumes the `manifests/` directory when you deploy the cluster.

</div>

# Network configuration phases

There are two phases prior to OpenShift Container Platform installation where you can customize the network configuration.

Phase 1
You can customize the following network-related fields in the `install-config.yaml` file before you create the manifest files:

- `networking.networkType`

- `networking.clusterNetwork`

- `networking.serviceNetwork`

- `networking.machineNetwork`

- `nodeNetworking`

  For more information, see "Installation configuration parameters".

  > [!NOTE]
  > Set the `networking.machineNetwork` to match the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) where the preferred subnet is located.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The CIDR range `172.17.0.0/16` is reserved by `libVirt`. You cannot use any other CIDR range that overlaps with the `172.17.0.0/16` CIDR range for networks in your cluster.

Phase 2
After creating the manifest files by running `openshift-install create manifests`, you can define a customized Cluster Network Operator manifest with only the fields you want to modify. You can use the manifest to specify an advanced network configuration.

During phase 2, you cannot override the values that you specified in phase 1 in the `install-config.yaml` file. However, you can customize the network plugin during phase 2.

# Specifying advanced network configuration

You can use advanced network configuration for your network plugin to integrate your cluster into your existing network environment.

You can specify advanced network configuration only before you install the cluster.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customizing your network configuration by modifying the OpenShift Container Platform manifest files created by the installation program is not supported. Applying a manifest file that you create, as in the following procedure, is supported.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have created the `install-config.yaml` file and completed any modifications to it.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
    ```

    - `<installation_directory>` specifies the name of the directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.

2.  Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named `cluster-network-03-config.yml` in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Network
    metadata:
      name: cluster
    spec:
    ```

3.  Specify the advanced network configuration for your cluster in the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file, such as in the following example:

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Enable IPsec for the OVN-Kubernetes network provider

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Network
    metadata:
      name: cluster
    spec:
      defaultNetwork:
        ovnKubernetesConfig:
          ipsecConfig:
            mode: Full
    ```

    </div>

4.  Optional: Back up the `manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml` file. The installation program consumes the `manifests/` directory when you create the Ignition config files.

5.  Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machines and compute `MachineSets`:

    ``` terminal
    $ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*.yaml
    ```

    Because you create and manage these resources yourself, you do not have to initialize them.

    - You can preserve the `MachineSet` files to create compute machines by using the machine API, but you must update references to them to match your environment.

</div>

# Cluster Network Operator configuration

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To manage cluster networking, configure the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) `Network` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` so the cluster uses the correct IP ranges and network plugin settings for reliable pod and service connectivity. Some settings and fields are inherited at the time of install or by the `default.Network.type` plugin, OVN-Kubernetes.

</div>

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the `Network` API in the `Network.config.openshift.io` API group:

`clusterNetwork`
IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.

`serviceNetwork`
IP address pool for services.

`defaultNetwork.type`
Cluster network plugin. `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported plugin during installation.

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the `defaultNetwork` object in the CNO object named `cluster`.

## Cluster Network Operator configuration object

# Configuring hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes

You can configure your cluster to use hybrid networking with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. This allows a hybrid cluster that supports different node networking configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> This configuration is necessary to run both Linux and Windows nodes in the same cluster.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You defined `OVNKubernetes` for the `networking.networkType` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file. See the installation documentation for configuring OpenShift Container Platform network customizations on your chosen cloud provider for more information.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:

    ``` terminal
    $ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
    ```

    where:

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specifies the name of the directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.

2.  Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named `cluster-network-03-config.yml` in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory:

    ``` terminal
    $ cat <<EOF > <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml
    apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Network
    metadata:
      name: cluster
    spec:
    EOF
    ```

    where:

    `<installation_directory>`
    Specifies the directory name that contains the `manifests/` directory for your cluster.

3.  Open the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file in an editor and configure OVN-Kubernetes with hybrid networking, as in the following example:

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Specify a hybrid networking configuration

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Network
    metadata:
      name: cluster
    spec:
      defaultNetwork:
        ovnKubernetesConfig:
          hybridOverlayConfig:
            hybridClusterNetwork:
            - cidr: 10.132.0.0/14
              hostPrefix: 23
            hybridOverlayVXLANPort: 9898
    ```

    </div>

    - Specify the CIDR configuration used for nodes on the additional overlay network. The `hybridClusterNetwork` CIDR must not overlap with the `clusterNetwork` CIDR.

    - Specify a custom VXLAN port for the additional overlay network. This is required for running Windows nodes in a cluster installed on vSphere, and must not be configured for any other cloud provider. The custom port can be any open port excluding the default `6081` port. For more information on this requirement, see [Pod-to-pod connectivity between hosts is broken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/kubernetes/common-problems#pod-to-pod-connectivity-between-hosts-is-broken-on-my-kubernetes-cluster-running-on-vsphere) in the Microsoft documentation.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Windows Server Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC): Windows Server 2019 is not supported on clusters with a custom `hybridOverlayVXLANPort` value because this Windows server version does not support selecting a custom VXLAN port.

4.  Save the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file and quit the text editor.

5.  Optional: Back up the `manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml` file. The installation program deletes the `manifests/` directory when creating the cluster.

</div>

# Deploying the cluster

You can install OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can run the `create cluster` command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.

- You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

- You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command:

  ``` terminal
  $ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \
      --log-level=info
  ```

  - For `<installation_directory>`, specify the location of your customized `./install-config.yaml` file.

  - To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or `error` instead of `info`.

</div>

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

</div>

- The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user.

- Credential information also outputs to `<installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example output

</div>

``` terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for *Recovering from expired control plane certificates* for more information.
>
> - It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">
