Procedure

</div>

The following procedure enables tab completion for Bash.

</div>

1.  Save the Bash completion code to a file:

    ``` terminal
    $ tkn completion bash > tkn_bash_completion
    ```

2.  Copy the file to `/etc/bash_completion.d/`:

    ``` terminal
    $ sudo cp tkn_bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d/
    ```

    Alternatively, you can save the file to a local directory and source it from your `.bashrc` file instead.

Tab completion is enabled when you open a new terminal.
