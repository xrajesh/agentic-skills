# About the opm CLI

The `opm` CLI tool is provided by the Operator Framework for use with the Operator bundle format. This tool allows you to create and maintain catalogs of Operators from a list of Operator bundles that are similar to software repositories. The result is a container image which can be stored in a container registry and then installed on a cluster.

A catalog contains a database of pointers to Operator manifest content that can be queried through an included API that is served when the container image is run. On OpenShift Container Platform, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can reference the image in a catalog source, defined by a `CatalogSource` object, which polls the image at regular intervals to enable frequent updates to installed Operators on the cluster.
