# Flowlogs-Pipeline does not consume network flows after installing Kafka

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Resolve issues where the flow-pipeline fails to consume network flows from Kafka by manually restarting the flow-pipeline pods to restore the connection between the flow collector and your Kafka deployment.

</div>

If you deployed the flow collector first with `deploymentModel: KAFKA` and then deployed Kafka, the flow collector might not connect correctly to Kafka. Manually restart the flow-pipeline pods where Flowlogs-pipeline does not consume network flows from Kafka.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Delete the flow-pipeline pods to restart them by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc delete pods -n netobserv -l app=flowlogs-pipeline-transformer
    ```

</div>

# Failing to see network flows from both br-int and br-ex interfaces

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Resolve issues with missing network flows by removing interface restrictions on virtual bridge devices like `br-int` and `br-ex`, ensuring the eBPF agent can attach to the appropriate Layer 3 interfaces.

</div>

`br-ex` and `br-int` are virtual bridge devices operated at OSI layer 2. The eBPF agent works at the IP and TCP levels, layers 3 and 4 respectively. You can expect that the eBPF agent captures the network traffic passing through `br-ex` and `br-int`, when the network traffic is processed by other interfaces such as physical host or virtual pod interfaces. If you restrict the eBPF agent network interfaces to attach only to `br-ex` and `br-int`, you do not see any network flow.

Manually remove the part in the `interfaces` or `excludeInterfaces` that restricts the network interfaces to `br-int` and `br-ex`.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Remove the `interfaces: [ 'br-int', 'br-ex' ]` field. This allows the agent to fetch information from all the interfaces. Alternatively, you can specify the Layer-3 interface for example, `eth0`. Run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit -n netobserv flowcollector.yaml -o yaml
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

# Network observability controller manager pod runs out of memory

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Resolve memory issues with the Network Observability Operator by increasing the memory limits in the `Subscription` object to prevent the controller manager pod from running out of memory.

</div>

You can increase memory limits for the Network Observability Operator by editing the `spec.config.resources.limits.memory` specification in the `Subscription` object.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  In the web console, navigate to **Ecosystem** → **Installed Operators**

2.  Click **Network Observability** and then select **Subscription**.

3.  From the **Actions** menu, click **Edit Subscription**.

    1.  Alternatively, you can use the CLI to open the YAML configuration for the `Subscription` object by running the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc edit subscription netobserv-operator -n openshift-netobserv-operator
        ```

4.  Edit the `Subscription` object to add the `config.resources.limits.memory` specification and set the value to account for your memory requirements. See the Additional resources for more information about resource considerations:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Subscription
    metadata:
      name: netobserv-operator
      namespace: openshift-netobserv-operator
    spec:
      channel: stable
      config:
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 800Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
      installPlanApproval: Automatic
      name: netobserv-operator
      source: redhat-operators
      sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
      startingCSV: <network_observability_operator_latest_version>
    ```

    - For example, you can increase the memory limit to `800Mi`.

    - This value should not be edited, but note that it changes depending on the most current release of the Operator.

# Running custom queries to Loki

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Troubleshoot network flow data by running custom Loki queries to retrieve available labels or filter logs by specific criteria, such as source namespaces, using the command-line interface.

</div>

There are two examples of ways to do this, which you can adapt according to your needs by replacing the \<api_token\> with your own.

> [!NOTE]
> These examples use the `netobserv` namespace for the Network Observability Operator and Loki deployments. Additionally, the examples assume that the LokiStack is named `loki`. You can optionally use a different namespace and naming by adapting the examples, specifically the `-n netobserv` or the `loki-gateway` URL.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Installed Loki Operator for use with Network Observability Operator.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  To get all available labels, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc exec deployment/netobserv-plugin -n netobserv -- curl -G -s -H 'X-Scope-OrgID:network' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' -k https://loki-gateway-http.netobserv.svc:8080/api/logs/v1/network/loki/api/v1/labels | jq
    ```

2.  To get all flows from the source namespace, `my-namespace`, run the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc exec deployment/netobserv-plugin -n netobserv -- curl -G -s -H 'X-Scope-OrgID:network' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' -k https://loki-gateway-http.netobserv.svc:8080/api/logs/v1/network/loki/api/v1/query --data-urlencode 'query={SrcK8S_Namespace="my-namespace"}' | jq

# Troubleshooting Loki ResourceExhausted error

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Resolve Loki `ResourceExhausted` errors by adjusting the `batchSize` in the `FlowCollector` resource or the maximum message size settings in your Loki configuration to ensure flow data stays within memory limits.

</div>

Loki may return a `ResourceExhausted` error when network flow data sent by network observability exceeds the configured maximum message size. If you are using the Red Hat Loki Operator, this maximum message size is configured to 100 MiB.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Navigate to **Ecosystem** → **Installed Operators**, viewing **All projects** from the **Project** drop-down menu.

2.  In the **Provided APIs** list, select the Network Observability Operator.

3.  Click the **Flow Collector** then the **YAML view** tab.

    1.  If you are using the Loki Operator, check that the `spec.loki.batchSize` value does not exceed 98 MiB.

    2.  If you are using a Loki installation method that is different from the Red Hat Loki Operator, such as Grafana Loki, verify that the `grpc_server_max_recv_msg_size` [Grafana Loki server setting](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/#server) is higher than the `FlowCollector` resource `spec.loki.batchSize` value. If it is not, you must either increase the `grpc_server_max_recv_msg_size` value, or decrease the `spec.loki.batchSize` value so that it is lower than the limit.

4.  Click **Save** if you edited the **FlowCollector**.

# Loki empty ring error

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Investigate and resolve Loki "empty ring" errors by checking pod health, clearing old persistent volume claims, or restarting pods to restore connectivity and ensure network flows are properly stored and displayed.

</div>

The Loki "empty ring" error results in flows not being stored in Loki and not showing up in the web console. This error might happen in various situations. A single workaround to address them all does not exist. There are some actions you can take to investigate the logs in your Loki pods, and verify that the `LokiStack` is healthy and ready.

Some of the situations where this error is observed are as follows:

- After a `LokiStack` is uninstalled and reinstalled in the same namespace, old PVCs are not removed, which can cause this error.

  - **Action**: You can try removing the `LokiStack` again, removing the PVC, then reinstalling the `LokiStack`.

- After a certificate rotation, this error can prevent communication with the `flowlogs-pipeline` and `console-plugin` pods.

  - **Action**: You can restart the pods to restore the connectivity.

# LokiStack rate limit errors

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Resolve Loki rate limit errors and prevent data loss by updating the `LokiStack` resource to increase the ingestion rate and burst limits for your network observability data streams.

</div>

A rate-limit placed on the Loki tenant can result in potential temporary loss of data and a 429 error: `Per stream rate limit exceeded (limit:xMB/sec) while attempting to ingest for stream`. You might consider having an alert set to notify you of this error. For more information, see "Creating Loki rate limit alerts for the NetObserv dashboard" in the Additional resources of this section.

You can update the LokiStack CRD with the `perStreamRateLimit` and `perStreamRateLimitBurst` specifications, as shown in the following procedure.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Navigate to **Ecosystem** → **Installed Operators**, viewing **All projects** from the **Project** dropdown.

2.  Look for **Loki Operator**, and select the **LokiStack** tab.

3.  Create or edit an existing **LokiStack** instance using the **YAML view** to add the `perStreamRateLimit` and `perStreamRateLimitBurst` specifications:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
    kind: LokiStack
    metadata:
      name: loki
      namespace: netobserv
    spec:
      limits:
        global:
          ingestion:
            perStreamRateLimit: 6
            perStreamRateLimitBurst: 30
      tenants:
        mode: openshift-network
      managementState: Managed
    ```

    - The default value for `perStreamRateLimit` is `3`.

    - The default value for `perStreamRateLimitBurst` is `15`.

4.  Click **Save**.

</div>

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

Once you update the `perStreamRateLimit` and `perStreamRateLimitBurst` specifications, the pods in your cluster restart and the 429 rate-limit error no longer occurs.

</div>

# Running a large query results in Loki errors

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Understand how you can mitigate Loki timeout and request errors when running large queries by using indexed filters, leveraging Prometheus for long time ranges, creating custom metrics, or adjusting Loki and FlowCollector performance settings.

</div>

When running large queries for a long time, Loki errors can occur, such as a `timeout` or `too many outstanding requests`. There is no complete corrective for this issue, but there are several ways to mitigate it:

Adapt your query to add an indexed filter
With Loki queries, you can query on both indexed and non-indexed fields or labels. Queries that contain filters on labels perform better. For example, if you query for a particular Pod, which is not an indexed field, you can add its Namespace to the query. The list of indexed fields can be found in the "Network flows format reference", in the `Loki label` column.

Consider querying Prometheus rather than Loki
Prometheus is a better fit than Loki to query on large time ranges. However, whether or not you can use Prometheus instead of Loki depends on the use case. For example, queries on Prometheus are much faster than on Loki, and large time ranges do not impact performance. But Prometheus metrics do not contain as much information as flow logs in Loki. The Network Observability OpenShift web console automatically favors Prometheus over Loki if the query is compatible; otherwise, it defaults to Loki. If your query does not run against Prometheus, you can change some filters or aggregations to make the switch. In the OpenShift web console, you can force the use of Prometheus. An error message is displayed when incompatible queries fail, which can help you figure out which labels to change to make the query compatible. For example, changing a filter or an aggregation from **Resource** or **Pods** to **Owner**.

Consider using the FlowMetrics API to create your own metric
If the data that you need isn’t available as a Prometheus metric, you can use the FlowMetrics API to create your own metric. For more information, see "FlowMetrics API Reference" and "Configuring custom metrics by using FlowMetric API".

Configure Loki to improve the query performance
If the problem persists, you can consider configuring Loki to improve the query performance. Some options depend on the installation mode you used for Loki, such as using the Operator and `LokiStack`, or `Monolithic` mode, or `Microservices` mode.

- In `LokiStack` or `Microservices` modes, try [increasing the number of querier replicas](https://loki-operator.dev/docs/api.md/#loki-grafana-com-v1-LokiComponentSpec).

- Increase the [query timeout](https://loki-operator.dev/docs/api.md/#loki-grafana-com-v1-QueryLimitSpec). You must also increase the Network Observability read timeout to Loki in the `FlowCollector` `spec.loki.readTimeout`.
