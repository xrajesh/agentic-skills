Description
AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute is a CRD allowing the cluster administrators to configure policies for external gateway IPs to be applied to all the pods contained in selected namespaces. Egress traffic from the pods that belong to the selected namespaces to outside the cluster is routed through these external gateway IPs.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |
