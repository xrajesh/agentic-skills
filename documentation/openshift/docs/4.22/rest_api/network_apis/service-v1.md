<td style="text-align: left;"><p>externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service’s "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.</p>

| `dryRun` | `string` | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `fieldValidation` | `string` | fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |
