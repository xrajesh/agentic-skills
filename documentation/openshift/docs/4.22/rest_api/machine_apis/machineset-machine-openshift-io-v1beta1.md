| `providerID` | `string` | providerID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider. This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine. This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete. This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider. |

| `taints` | `array` | The list of the taints to be applied to the corresponding Node in additive manner. This list will not overwrite any other taints added to the Node on an ongoing basis by other entities. These taints should be actively reconciled e.g. if you ask the machine controller to apply a taint and then manually remove the taint the machine controller will put it back) but not have the machine controller remove any taints |
| `taints[]` | `object` | The node this Taint is attached to has the "effect" on any pod that does not tolerate the Taint. |

| Property | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|

| `severity` | `string` | severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately understand the current situation and act accordingly. The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False. |
| `status` | `string` | status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown. |
| `type` | `string` | type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. |

Description

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `dryRun` | `string` | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `fieldValidation` | `string` | fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |
