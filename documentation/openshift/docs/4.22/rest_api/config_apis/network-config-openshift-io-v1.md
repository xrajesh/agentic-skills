Description
Network holds cluster-wide information about Network. The canonical name is `cluster`. It is used to configure the desired network configuration, such as: IP address pools for services/pod IPs, network plugin, etc. Please view network.spec for an explanation on what applies when configuring this resource.

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

|----|----|----|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources> |
| `kind` | `string` | Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated.

| `spec` | `object` | spec holds user settable values for configuration. As a general rule, this SHOULD NOT be read directly.

Please view the individual ones for further details on each. |
| `status` | `object` | status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden. |
