## .spec.requiredHSTSPolicies

Description
requiredHSTSPolicies specifies HSTS policies that are required to be set on newly created or updated routes matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy. Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route annotation, and affect route admission.

A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation: "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header" E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains

- For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted. Otherwise, the route is rejected.

- The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies determines the route’s admission status.

- If the candidate route doesn’t match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.

The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration. However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.

Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

## .status.componentRoutes\[\].conditions

Description
conditions are used to communicate the state of the componentRoutes entry.

Supported conditions include Available, Degraded and Progressing.

If available is true, the content served by the route can be accessed by users. This includes cases where a default may continue to serve content while the customized route specified by the cluster-admin is being configured.

If Degraded is true, that means something has gone wrong trying to handle the componentRoutes entry. The currentHostnames field may or may not be in effect.

If Progressing is true, that means the component is taking some action related to the componentRoutes entry.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `lastTransitionTime` | `string` | lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable. |
| `message` | `string` | message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string. |
| `observedGeneration` | `integer` | observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions\[x\].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance. |
| `reason` | `string` | reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition’s last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty. |
| `status` | `string` | status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown. |

| `dryRun` | `string` | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `fieldValidation` | `string` | fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |
