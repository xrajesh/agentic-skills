Description
Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster. Events have a limited retention time and triggers and messages may evolve with time. Event consumers should not rely on the timing of an event with a given Reason reflecting a consistent underlying trigger, or the continued existence of events with that Reason. Events should be treated as informative, best-effort, supplemental data.

|----|----|----|
| `action` | `string` | What action was taken/failed regarding to the Regarding object. |
| `apiVersion` | `string` | APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources> |
| `count` | `integer` | The number of times this event has occurred. |
| `eventTime` | [`MicroTime`](../objects/index.xml#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-MicroTime) | Time when this Event was first observed. |
| `firstTimestamp` | [`Time`](../objects/index.xml#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-Time) | The time at which the event was first recorded. (Time of server receipt is in TypeMeta.) |
| `involvedObject` | `object` | ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object. |
| `kind` | `string` | Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds> |
| `lastTimestamp` | [`Time`](../objects/index.xml#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-Time) | The time at which the most recent occurrence of this event was recorded. |
| `message` | `string` | A human-readable description of the status of this operation. |
| `metadata` | [`ObjectMeta`](../objects/index.xml#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta) | Standard object’s metadata. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata> |

| `related` | `object` | ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object. |
| `reportingComponent` | `string` | Name of the controller that emitted this Event, e.g. `kubernetes.io/kubelet`. |
| `reportingInstance` | `string` | ID of the controller instance, e.g. `kubelet-xyzf`. |

| `source` | `object` | EventSource contains information for an event. |
| `type` | `string` | Type of this event (Normal, Warning), new types could be added in the future |

Type
`object`

| Property | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | API version of the referent. |
| `fieldPath` | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers\[2\]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers\[2\]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. |
