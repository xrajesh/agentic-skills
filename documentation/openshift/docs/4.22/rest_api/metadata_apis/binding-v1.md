Description
Binding ties one object to another; for example, a pod is bound to a node by a scheduler.

Type
`object`

Required
- `target`

# Specification

| Property | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources> |
| `kind` | `string` | Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds> |
| `metadata` | [`ObjectMeta`](../objects/index.xml#io-k8s-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1-ObjectMeta) | Standard object’s metadata. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata> |
| `target` | `object` | ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object. |

## .target

Description
ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object.

Type
`object`

| Property | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | API version of the referent. |
| `fieldPath` | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers\[2\]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers\[2\]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. |
| `kind` | `string` | Kind of the referent. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds> |
| `name` | `string` | Name of the referent. More info: <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names> |
| `namespace` | `string` | Namespace of the referent. More info: <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/> |
| `resourceVersion` | `string` | Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency> |
| `uid` | `string` | UID of the referent. More info: <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids> |

# API endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- `/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/bindings`

  - `POST`: create a Binding

- `/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}/binding`

  - `POST`: create binding of a Pod

## /api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/bindings

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `dryRun` | `string` | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `fieldValidation` | `string` | fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |
