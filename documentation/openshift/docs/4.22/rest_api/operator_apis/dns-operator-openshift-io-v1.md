Description
DNS manages the CoreDNS component to provide a name resolution service for pods and services in the cluster.

This supports the DNS-based service discovery specification: <https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md>

More details: <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/coredns>

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

## .spec.cache

Description
cache describes the caching configuration that applies to all server blocks listed in the Corefile. This field allows a cluster admin to optionally configure: \* positiveTTL which is a duration for which positive responses should be cached. \* negativeTTL which is a duration for which negative responses should be cached. If this is not configured, OpenShift will configure positive and negative caching with a default value that is subject to change. At the time of writing, the default positiveTTL is 900 seconds and the default negativeTTL is 30 seconds or as noted in the respective Corefile for your version of OpenShift.

## .spec.nodePlacement

Description
nodePlacement provides explicit control over the scheduling of DNS pods.

Generally, it is useful to run a DNS pod on every node so that DNS queries are always handled by a local DNS pod instead of going over the network to a DNS pod on another node. However, security policies may require restricting the placement of DNS pods to specific nodes. For example, if a security policy prohibits pods on arbitrary nodes from communicating with the API, a node selector can be specified to restrict DNS pods to nodes that are permitted to communicate with the API. Conversely, if running DNS pods on nodes with a particular taint is desired, a toleration can be specified for that taint.

If unset, defaults are used. See nodePlacement for more details.

## .spec.nodePlacement.tolerations

Description
tolerations is a list of tolerations applied to DNS pods.

If empty, the DNS operator sets a toleration for the "node-role.kubernetes.io/master" taint. This default is subject to change. Specifying tolerations without including a toleration for the "node-role.kubernetes.io/master" taint may be risky as it could lead to an outage if all worker nodes become unavailable.

Note that the daemon controller adds some tolerations as well. See <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/>

Type
`array`

## .spec.nodePlacement.tolerations\[\]

Description
The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches the triple \<key,value,effect\> using the matching operator \<operator\>.

Type
`object`

| Property | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `effect` | `string` | Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute. |
| `key` | `string` | Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys. |
| `operator` | `string` | Operator represents a key’s relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category. |
| `tolerationSeconds` | `integer` | TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system. |
| `value` | `string` | Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string. |

## .spec.servers

Description
servers is a list of DNS resolvers that provide name query delegation for one or more subdomains outside the scope of the cluster domain. If servers consists of more than one Server, longest suffix match will be used to determine the Server.

For example, if there are two Servers, one for "foo.com" and another for "a.foo.com", and the name query is for "www.a.foo.com", it will be routed to the Server with Zone "a.foo.com".

If this field is nil, no servers are created.

| `forwardPlugin` | `object` | forwardPlugin defines a schema for configuring CoreDNS to proxy DNS messages to upstream resolvers. |
| `name` | `string` | name is required and specifies a unique name for the server. Name must comply with the Service Name Syntax of rfc6335. |
| `zones` | `array (string)` | zones is required and specifies the subdomains that Server is authoritative for. Zones must conform to the rfc1123 definition of a subdomain. Specifying the cluster domain (i.e., "cluster.local") is invalid. |

## .spec.upstreamResolvers.transportConfig.tls.caBundle

Description
caBundle references a ConfigMap that must contain either a single CA Certificate or a CA Bundle. This allows cluster administrators to provide their own CA or CA bundle for validating the certificate of upstream resolvers.

1.  The configmap must contain a `ca-bundle.crt` key.

2.  The value must be a PEM encoded CA certificate or CA bundle.

3.  The administrator must create this configmap in the openshift-config namespace.

4.  The upstream server certificate must contain a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) that matches ServerName.

| `name`   | `string` | name is the metadata.name of the referenced config map |

## .spec.upstreamResolvers.upstreams

Description
upstreams is a list of resolvers to forward name queries for the "." domain. Each instance of CoreDNS performs health checking of Upstreams. When a healthy upstream returns an error during the exchange, another resolver is tried from Upstreams. The Upstreams are selected in the order specified in Policy.

A maximum of 15 upstreams is allowed per ForwardPlugin. If no Upstreams are specified, /etc/resolv.conf is used by default

Type
`array`

## .spec.upstreamResolvers.upstreams\[\]

Description
Upstream can either be of type SystemResolvConf, or of type Network.

- For an Upstream of type SystemResolvConf, no further fields are necessary: The upstream will be configured to use /etc/resolv.conf.

- For an Upstream of type Network, a NetworkResolver field needs to be defined with an IP address or IP:port if the upstream listens on a port other than 53.

## .status.conditions

Description
conditions provide information about the state of the DNS on the cluster.

These are the supported DNS conditions:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `lastTransitionTime` | `string` | lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable. |

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `dryRun` | `string` | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed |
| `fieldValidation` | `string` | fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |
