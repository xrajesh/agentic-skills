The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* is a small and streamlined container registry that you can use as a target for mirroring the required container images of OpenShift Container Platform for disconnected installations.

If you already have a container image registry, such as [Red Hat Quay](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay), you can skip this section and go straight to [Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository](../disconnected/installing-mirroring-installation-images.xml#installation-mirror-repository_installing-mirroring-installation-images).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* is not intended to be a substitute for a production deployment of Red Hat Quay.

# Prerequisites

- An OpenShift Container Platform subscription.

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 and 9 with Podman 3.4.2 or later and OpenSSL installed. If you are using Podman 5.7 or later, see "Configuring rootless Podman networking".

- Fully qualified domain name for the Red Hat Quay service, which must resolve through a DNS server.

- Key-based SSH connectivity on the target host. SSH keys are automatically generated for local installs. For remote hosts, you must generate your own SSH keys.

- 2 or more vCPUs.

- 8 GB of RAM.

- About 12 GB for OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 release images, or about 358 GB for OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 release images and OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 Red Hat Operator images.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > - Up to 1 TB per stream or more is suggested.
  >
  > - These requirements are based on local testing results with only release images and Operator images. Storage requirements can vary based on your organization’s needs. You might require more space, for example, when you mirror multiple z-streams. You can use standard [Red Hat Quay functionality](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/use_red_hat_quay/index) or the proper [API callout](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index#deletefulltag) to remove unnecessary images and free up space.

# Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift introduction

For disconnected deployments of OpenShift Container Platform, a container registry is required to carry out the installation of the clusters. To run a production-grade registry service on such a cluster, you must create a separate registry deployment to install the first cluster. The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* addresses this need and is included in every OpenShift Container Platform subscription. It is available for download on the [OpenShift console **Downloads**](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-mirror-registry) page.

The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* allows users to install a small-scale version of Red Hat Quay and its required components by using the `mirror-registry` command-line interface (CLI) tool. The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* is deployed automatically with pre-configured local storage and a local database. It also includes auto-generated user credentials and access permissions with a single set of inputs and no additional configuration choices to get started.

The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* provides a pre-determined network configuration and reports deployed component credentials and access URLs upon success. A limited set of optional configuration inputs such as fully qualified domain name (FQDN) services, superuser name and password, and custom TLS certificates are also provided. This provides users with a container registry so that they can easily create an offline mirror of all OpenShift Container Platform release content when running OpenShift Container Platform in restricted network environments.

Use of the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* is optional if another container registry is already available in the install environment.

## Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift limitations

The following limitations apply to the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift*:

- The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* is not a highly-available registry and only local file system storage is supported. It is not intended to replace Red Hat Quay or the internal image registry for OpenShift Container Platform.

- The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* is not intended to be a substitute for a production deployment of Red Hat Quay.

- The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* is only supported for hosting images that are required to install a disconnected OpenShift Container Platform cluster, such as Release images or Red Hat Operator images. It uses local storage on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machine, and storage supported by RHEL is supported by the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift*.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Because the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* uses local storage, you should remain aware of the storage usage consumed when mirroring images and use Red Hat Quay’s garbage collection feature to mitigate potential issues. For more information about this feature, see "Red Hat Quay garbage collection".

- Support for Red Hat product images that are pushed to the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* for bootstrapping purposes are covered by valid subscriptions for each respective product. A list of exceptions to further enable the bootstrap experience can be found on the [Self-managed Red Hat OpenShift sizing and subscription guide](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/self-managed-openshift-sizing-subscription-guide).

- Content built by customers should not be hosted by the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift*.

- Using the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* with more than one cluster is discouraged because multiple clusters can create a single point of failure when updating your cluster fleet. Instead, use the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* to install a cluster that can host a production-grade, highly-available registry such as Red Hat Quay, which can serve OpenShift Container Platform content to other clusters.

# Configuring rootless Podman networking

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To restore rootless Podman networking when the default `pasta` stack fails on OpenShift Container Platform mirror or install hosts, you can set the default rootless network back to `slirp4netns` in the `/etc/containers/containers.conf` file, or in the user’s `~/.config/containers/container.conf` file.

</div>

You might need to configure rootless Podman networking after upgrading to RHEL 9.5 or Podman 5.0. In these versions, the default networking stack changed from `slirp4netns` to `pasta`. As a result, systems that previously operated without a default route might no longer be able to establish network connectivity and could display the following error:

``` terminal
Error: pasta failed with exit code 1:
External interface not usable
```

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have updated to RHEL 9.5 or Podman 5.0.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Use your preferred IDE to modify the `/etc/containers/containers.conf` or `~/.config/containers/container.conf` file.

    1.  To modify the `/etc/containers/containers.conf` file, enter the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ nano /etc/containers/containers.conf
        ```

    2.  To modify the `~/.config/containers/container.conf` file, enter the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ nano ~/.config/containers/container.conf
        ```

2.  Add, or update, the `[network]` section as in the following example:

    ``` text
    # ...
    [network]
    default_rootless_network_cmd = "slirp4netns"
    # ...
    ```

3.  Restart the Podman system as the rootless user by entering the following command. Note that all containers must be stopped and restarted for the change to take effect.

    ``` terminal
    $ podman system migrate
    ```

</div>

# Mirroring on a local host with mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift

This procedure explains how to install the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* on a local host by using the `mirror-registry` installer tool. By doing so, users can create a local host registry running on port 443 for the purpose of storing a mirror of OpenShift Container Platform images.

> [!NOTE]
> Installing the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* using the `mirror-registry` CLI tool makes several changes to your machine. After installation, a `$HOME/quay-install` directory is created, which has installation files, local storage, and the configuration bundle. Trusted SSH keys are generated in case the deployment target is the local host, and systemd files on the host machine are set up to ensure that container runtimes are persistent. Additionally, an initial user named `init` is created with an automatically generated password. All access credentials are printed at the end of the install routine.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Download the `mirror-registry.tar.gz` package for the latest version of the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* found on the [OpenShift console **Downloads**](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-mirror-registry) page.

2.  Install the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* on your local host with your current user account by using the `mirror-registry` tool. For a full list of available flags, see "mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift flags".

    ``` terminal
    $ ./mirror-registry install \
      --quayHostname <host_example_com> \
      --quayRoot <example_directory_name>
    ```

3.  Use the username and password generated during installation to log in to the registry by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ podman login -u init \
      -p <password> \
      <host_example_com>:8443> \
      --tls-verify=false
    ```

    - You can avoid running `--tls-verify=false` by configuring your system to trust the generated rootCA certificates. See "Securing Red Hat Quay" and "Configuring the system to trust the certificate authority" for more information.

      > [!NOTE]
      > You can also log in by accessing the UI at `https://<host.example.com>:8443` after installation.

4.  You can mirror OpenShift Container Platform images after logging in. Depending on your needs, see either the "Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository" or the "Mirroring Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters" sections of this document.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If there are issues with images stored by the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* due to storage layer problems, you can re-mirror the OpenShift Container Platform images, or reinstall mirror registry on more stable storage.

# Updating mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from a local host

This procedure explains how to update the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* from a local host by using the `upgrade` command. Updating to the latest version ensures new features, bug fixes, and security vulnerability fixes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When upgrading from version 1 to version 2, be aware of the following constraints:
>
> - The worker count is set to `1` because multiple writes are not allowed in SQLite.
>
> - You must not use the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* user interface (UP).
>
> - Do not access the `sqlite-storage` Podman volume during the upgrade.
>
> - There is intermittent downtime of your mirror registry because it is restarted during the upgrade process.
>
> - PostgreSQL data is backed up under the `/$HOME/quay-install/quay-postgres-backup/` directory for recovery.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- If you are upgrading the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* from 1.3 → 2.y, and your installation directory is the default at `/etc/quay-install`, you can enter the following command:

  ``` terminal
  $ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade -v
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > - *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* migrates Podman volumes for Red Hat Quay storage, Postgres data, and `/etc/quay-install` data to the new `$HOME/quay-install` location. This allows you to use *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* without the `--quayRoot` flag during future upgrades.
  >
  > - Users who upgrade *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* with the `./mirror-registry upgrade -v` flag must include the same credentials used when creating their mirror registry. For example, if you installed the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* with `--quayHostname <host_example_com>` and `--quayRoot <example_directory_name>`, you must include that string to properly upgrade the mirror registry.

- If you are upgrading *the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* from 1.3 → 2.y and you used a custom quay configuration and storage directory in your 1.y deployment, you must pass in the `--quayRoot` and `--quayStorage` flags. For example:

  ``` terminal
  $ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade --quayHostname <host_example_com> --quayRoot <example_directory_name>  --quayStorage <example_directory_name>/quay-storage -v
  ```

- If you are upgrading the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* from 1.3 → 2.y and want to specify a custom SQLite storage path, you must pass in the `--sqliteStorage` flag, for example:

  ``` terminal
  $ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade --sqliteStorage <example_directory_name>/sqlite-storage -v

# Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift flags

The following flags are available for the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift*:

| Flags | Description |
|----|----|
| `--autoApprove` | A boolean value that disables interactive prompts. If set to `true`, the `quayRoot` directory is automatically deleted when uninstalling the mirror registry. Defaults to `false` if left unspecified. |
| `--initPassword` | The password of the init user created during Quay installation. Must be at least eight characters and contain no whitespace. |
| `--initUser string` | Shows the username of the initial user. Defaults to `init` if left unspecified. |
| `--no-color`, `-c` | Allows users to disable color sequences and propagate that to Ansible when running install, uninstall, and upgrade commands. |
| `--quayHostname` | The fully-qualified domain name of the mirror registry that clients will use to contact the registry. Equivalent to `SERVER_HOSTNAME` in the Quay `config.yaml`. Must resolve by DNS. Defaults to `<targetHostname>:8443` if left unspecified. <sup>\[1\]</sup> |
| `--quayStorage` | The folder where Quay persistent storage data is saved. Defaults to the `quay-storage` Podman volume. Root privileges are required to uninstall. |
| `--quayRoot`, `-r` | The directory where container image layer and configuration data is saved, including `rootCA.key`, `rootCA.pem`, and `rootCA.srl` certificates. Defaults to `$HOME/quay-install` if left unspecified. |
| `--sqliteStorage` | The folder where SQLite database data is saved. Defaults to `sqlite-storage` Podman volume if not specified. Root is required to uninstall. |
| `--ssh-key`, `-k` | The path of your SSH identity key. Defaults to `~/.ssh/quay_installer` if left unspecified. |
| `--sslCert` | The path to the SSL/TLS public key / certificate. Defaults to `{quayRoot}/quay-config` and is auto-generated if left unspecified. |
| `--sslCheckSkip` | Skips the check for the certificate hostname against the `SERVER_HOSTNAME` in the `config.yaml` file. <sup>\[2\]</sup> |
| `--sslKey` | The path to the SSL/TLS private key used for HTTPS communication. Defaults to `{quayRoot}/quay-config` and is auto-generated if left unspecified. |
| `--targetHostname`, `-H` | The hostname of the target you want to install Quay to. Defaults to `$HOST`, for example, a local host, if left unspecified. |
| `--targetUsername`, `-u` | The user on the target host which will be used for SSH. Defaults to `$USER`, for example, the current user if left unspecified. |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Shows debug logs and Ansible Playbook outputs. |
| `--version` | Shows the version for the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift*. |

<div wrapper="1" role="small">

1.  `--quayHostname` must be modified if the public DNS name of your system is different from the local hostname. Additionally, the `--quayHostname` flag does not support installation with an IP address. Installation with a hostname is required.

2.  `--sslCheckSkip` is used in cases when the mirror registry is set behind a proxy and the exposed hostname is different from the internal Quay hostname. It can also be used when users do not want the certificates to be validated against the provided Quay hostname during installation.

# Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift release notes

The *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* is a small and streamlined container registry that you can use as a target for mirroring the required container images of OpenShift Container Platform for disconnected installations.

These release notes track the development of the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* in OpenShift Container Platform.

## Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift 2.0 release notes

The following sections provide details for each 2.0 release of the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift.

### Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift 2.0.10

Issued: 03 March 2026

*Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift* is now available with Red Hat Quay 3.12.14.

The following advisory is available for the *mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift*:

- [RHBA-2026:3953 - mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift 2.0.10](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2026:3953)

The following bugs were fixed as part of this release:

- [PROJQUAY-9799](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/PROJQUAY-9799). In this update, upgrading from PostgreSQL to SQLite without proper configuration previously triggered a SQLite cursor error.
