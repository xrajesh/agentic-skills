# Orchestrating DPUs with the DPU Operator

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use the Data Processing Unit (DPU) Operator to manage DPUs that offload networking, storage, and security workloads from host CPUs to improve cluster performance and efficiency.

</div>

A DPU is a type of programmable processor that represents one of the three fundamental pillars of computing, alongside CPUs and GPUs. While CPUs handle general computing tasks and GPUs accelerate specific workloads, the primary role of the DPU is to offload and accelerate data-centric workloads, such as networking, storage, and security functions.

DPUs are typically used in data centers and cloud environments to improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance security by offloading these tasks from the CPU. You can also use DPUs to create a more efficient and flexible infrastructure by enabling the deployment of specialized workloads closer to the data source.

The DPU Operator is responsible for managing the DPU devices and network attachments. The DPU Operator deploys the DPU daemon onto OpenShift Container Platform compute nodes that interface through an API controlling the DPU daemon running on the DPU. The DPU Operator is responsible for the life-cycle management of the `ovn-kube` components and the necessary host network initialization on the DPU.

The following table describes the currently supported DPU devices.

| Vendor | Device | Firmware | Description |
|----|----|----|----|
| Intel | IPU E2100 | Version 2.0.0.11126 or later | A DPU designed to offload networking, storage, and security tasks from host CPUs in data centers, improving efficiency and performance. For instructions on deploying a full end-to-end solution, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution [Accelerating Confidential AI on OpenShift with the Intel E2100 IPU, DPU Operator, and F5 NGINX](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7120276). |
| Senao | SX904 | 35.23.47.0008 or later | A SmartNIC designed to offload compute and network services from the host CPUs in data centers and edge computing environments, improving efficiency and isolation of workloads. |
| Marvell | Marvell Octeon 10 CN106 | SDK12.25.01 or later | A DPU designed to offload workloads that require high speed data processing from host CPUs in data centers and edge computing environments, improving performance and energy efficiency |

# Configuring the DPU Operator

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can configure the DPU Operator after installation to enable management of DPU devices and network attachments in both dual cluster and single cluster deployment modes.

</div>

You can configure the DPU Operator to manage the DPU devices and network attachments in your cluster.

To configure the DPU Operator follow these steps:

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create the `DpuOperatorConfig` Custom Resource (CR) based on your deployment mode:

    - Dual Cluster Deployment: You must create the `DpuOperatorConfig` CR on both the host OpenShift Container Platform cluster and on each of the Red Hat build of MicroShift (MicroShift) DPU clusters.

    - Single Cluster Deployment: This deployment uses a standard OpenShift Container Platform cluster. You only need to create the `DpuOperatorConfig` CR once on this cluster.

      The content of the CR is the same for all clusters.

2.  Create a file named `dpu-operator-config.yaml` by using the following YAML:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
    kind: DpuOperatorConfig
    metadata:
     name: dpu-operator-config
    spec:
     logLevel: 0
    ```

    - `metadata.name`: Specifies the name of the Custom Resource, which must be `dpu-operator-config`.

    - `spec.logLevel`: Sets the desired logging verbosity in the operator container logs. The value `0` is the default setting.

3.  Create the resource by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc apply -f dpu-operator-config.yaml
    ```

4.  Label all nodes that either have an attached DPU or are functioning as a DPU. You can apply this label by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc label node <node_name> dpu=true
    ```

    where:

    `node_name`
    Refers to the name of your node, such as `worker-1`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > There are two ways to deploy clusters that are compatible with DPUs:
    >
    > - Dual cluster deployment: This consists of OpenShift Container Platform running on the hosts and Red Hat build of MicroShift (MicroShift) running on the DPU. In this mode, the Red Hat build of MicroShift (MicroShift) instance also needs to deploy the DPU Operator, and you must set the label `dpu=true` on the node.
    >
    > - Single cluster deployment: This consists of only OpenShift Container Platform running on hosts, where the DPUs are integrated into the main cluster. DPUs just require the label `dpu=true` for both the host nodes with DPUs installed and the DPU nodes themselves. The DPU Operator automatically detects the role of the node whether it is running as a DPU or a host with an attached DPU.

</div>

# Running a workload on the host with DPU

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can deploy workloads on the host with DPU to offload specialized infrastructure tasks and improve performance while freeing up host CPU resources.

</div>

Running workloads on a DPU enables offloading specialized infrastructure tasks such as networking, security, and storage to a dedicated processing unit. This improves performance, enforces a stronger security boundary between infrastructure and application workloads, and frees up host CPU resources.

Follow these steps to deploy a workload on the host with DPU. This is the standard deployment model where the application runs on the host’s x86 CPU but utilizes the DPU for network acceleration and offload.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.

- An account with `cluster-admin` privileges is available.

- The DPU Operator is installed.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create a sample workload designed to run on the host-side worker node by using the following YAML. Save the file as `workload-host.yaml`:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-pod
      namespace: default
      annotations:
        k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: default-sriov-net
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/hostname: worker-237
      containers:
      - name: appcntr1
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest
        command: ['/bin/sh', '-c', 'sleep infinity']
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        securityContext:
          priviledged: true
          runAsNonRoot: false
          runAsUser: 0
          seccompProfile:
            type: RuntimeDefault
        resources:
          requests:
            openshift.io/dpu: '1'
          limits:
            openshift.io/dpu: '1'
    ```

    `spec.nodeSelector`: The node selector schedules the pod on the node with the DPU resource. You can use any standard Kubernetes selector for this, such as `kubernetes.io/hostname`, to target a specific node as shown in the example YAML.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For flexible scheduling, the DPU Operator creates the label dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside: "dpu-host". This label enables the default scheduler to place the workload on any host with a DPU. The workload automatically joins that DPU secondary network. When the label on the node is `dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside: "dpu"`, this signifies that the node is the DPU itself. The DPU Operator creates and manages the `dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside` label .

2.  Create the workload by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc apply -f workload-host.yaml
    ```

</div>

# Running a workload on the DPU

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can deploy network workloads directly on the DPU to improve performance, enhance security isolation, and reduce host CPU usage.

</div>

The DPU offloads network workloads, such as security functions or virtualized appliances, to improve performance, enhance security isolation, and free host CPU resources.

Follow this procedure to deploy a simple pod directly onto the DPU.

<div>

Prerequisites

</div>

- Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

- An account with `cluster-admin` privileges.

- Install the DPU Operator.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Save the following YAML file example as `dpu-pod.yaml`. This is an example of a simple pod that will be scheduled directly onto a DPU node by the Kubernetes default scheduler.

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: "my-network-function"
      namespace: openshift-dpu-operator
      annotations:
        k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: dpunfcni-conf, dpunfcni-conf
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside: "dpu"
      containers:
        - name: "my-network-function"
          image: "quay.io/example-org/my-network-function:latest"
          resources:
            requests:
              openshift.io/dpu: "2"
            limits:
              openshift.io/dpu: "2"
          securityContext:
            privileged: true
            capabilities:
              drop:
                - ALL
              add:
                - NET_RAW
                - NET_ADMIN
    ```

    - `metadata.name.annotations.k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`: The value `dpunfcni-conf` specifies the name of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` resource. The DPU Operator creates this resource during installation to configure the DPU networking.

    - `spec.nodeSelector`: The `nodeSelector` is the primary mechanism for scheduling this workload. The DPU Operator creates and maintains the label: `dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside: "dpu"`. This label ensures the pod is scheduled directly onto the DPU’s processing unit.

    - `spec.containers.name`: The name of the container.

    - `spec.containers.image`: The container image to pull and run.

2.  Create the pod by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc apply -f dpu-pod.yaml
    ```

3.  Verify the pod status by running the following command:

    ``` bash
    $ oc get pods -n openshift-dpu-operator
    ```

    Ensure the pod’s status is `Running`.
