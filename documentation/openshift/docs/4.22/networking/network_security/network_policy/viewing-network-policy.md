As a cluster administrator, you can view a network policy for a namespace.

# Example NetworkPolicy object

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Reference the example `NetworkPolicy` object to understand how to configure this object.

</div>

``` yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-27107
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: app
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
```

where:

`name`
The name of the NetworkPolicy object.

`spec.podSelector`
A selector that describes the pods to which the policy applies. The policy object can only select pods in the project that defines the NetworkPolicy object.

`ingress.from.podSelector`
A selector that matches the pods from which the policy object allows ingress traffic. The selector matches pods in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.

`ingress.ports`
A list of one or more destination ports on which to accept traffic.

# Viewing network policies using the CLI

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can examine the network policies in a namespace.

Procedure

</div>

1.  List network policies in a namespace.

    1.  To view network policy objects defined in a namespace enter the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get networkpolicy
        ```

    2.  Optional: To examine a specific network policy enter the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc describe networkpolicy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
        ```

        where:

        `<policy_name>`
        Specifies the name of the network policy to inspect.

        `<namespace>`
        Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.

        ``` terminal
        $ oc describe networkpolicy allow-same-namespace
        ```

        ``` text
        Name:         allow-same-namespace
        Namespace:    ns1
        Created on:   2021-05-24 22:28:56 -0400 EDT
        Labels:       <none>
        Annotations:  <none>
        Spec:
          PodSelector:     <none> (Allowing the specific traffic to all pods in this namespace)
          Allowing ingress traffic:
            To Port: <any> (traffic allowed to all ports)
            From:
              PodSelector: <none>
          Not affecting egress traffic
          Policy Types: Ingress
        ```
