Procedure

</div>

- To delete a network policy object, enter the following command. Successful output lists the name of the policy object and the `deleted` status.

  ``` terminal
  $ oc delete networkpolicy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
  ```

  where:

  `<policy_name>`
  Specifies the name of the network policy.

  `<namespace>`
  Optional parameter. If you defined the object in a different namespace than the current namespace, the parameter specifices the namespace.
