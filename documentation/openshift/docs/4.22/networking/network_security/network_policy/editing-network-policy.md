# Editing a network policy

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To modify existing policy configurations, you can edit a network policy in a namespace. Edit policies by modifying the policy file and applying it with `oc apply`, or by using the `oc edit` command directly.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> If you log in with `cluster-admin` privileges, you can edit network policies in any namespace in the cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> If you log in with `cluster-admin` privileges, you can edit network policies in any namespace in the cluster. In the web console, you can edit policies directly in YAML or by using the **Actions** menu.

Prerequisites

</div>

- Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports `NetworkPolicy` objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set.

- You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

- You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `admin` privileges.

- You are working in the namespace where the network policy exists.

Procedure

</div>

1.  Optional: To list the network policy objects in a namespace, enter the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get network policy -n <namespace>
    ```

    where:

    `<namespace>`
    Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.

2.  Edit the network policy object.

    1.  If you saved the network policy definition in a file, edit the file and make any necessary changes, and then enter the following command.

        ``` terminal
        $ oc apply -n <namespace> -f <policy_file>.yaml
        ```

        where:

        `<namespace>`
        Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.

        `<policy_file>`
        Specifies the name of the file containing the network policy.

    2.  If you need to update the network policy object directly, enter the following command:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc edit network policy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
        ```

        where:

        `<policy_name>`
        Specifies the name of the network policy.

        `<namespace>`
        Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.

3.  Confirm that the network policy object is updated.

    ``` terminal
    $ oc describe networkpolicy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

    where:

    `<policy_name>`
    Specifies the name of the network policy.

    `<namespace>`
    Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.

# Example NetworkPolicy object

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Reference the example `NetworkPolicy` object to understand how to configure this object.

</div>

``` yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-27107
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: app
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
```

where:

`name`
The name of the NetworkPolicy object.

`spec.podSelector`
A selector that describes the pods to which the policy applies. The policy object can only select pods in the project that defines the NetworkPolicy object.

`ingress.from.podSelector`
A selector that matches the pods from which the policy object allows ingress traffic. The selector matches pods in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.

`ingress.ports`
A list of one or more destination ports on which to accept traffic.
