To secure application traffic and serve custom certificates to clients, configure routes by using edge, passthrough, or re-encrypt TLS termination. By using these methods, you can define granular encryption rules, ensuring that traffic is decrypted and re-encrypted according to your specific security requirements.

# Creating an edge route with a custom certificate

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To secure traffic by using a custom certificate, configure a route with edge TLS termination by running the `oc create route` command. This configuration terminates encryption at the Ingress Controller before forwarding traffic to the destination pod.

</div>

The route specifies the TLS certificate and key that the Ingress Controller uses for the route.

The procedure creates a `Route` resource with a custom certificate and edge TLS termination. The procedure assumes that the certificate/key pair are in the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` files in the current working directory. You may also specify a CA certificate if needed to complete the certificate chain. Substitute the actual path names for `tls.crt`, `tls.key`, and (optionally) `ca.crt`. Substitute the name of the service that you want to expose for `frontend`. Substitute the appropriate hostname for `www.example.com`.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate is valid for the route host.

- You might have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes the certificate chain.

- You must have a service that you want to expose.

# Creating a route using the destination CA certificate in the Ingress annotation

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To define a route with a custom destination CA certificate, apply the `route.openshift.io/destination-ca-certificate-secret` annotation to an Ingress object. This configuration ensures the Ingress Controller uses the specified secret to verify the identity of the destination service.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate is valid for the route host.

- You have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes the certificate chain.

- You have a separate destination CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file.

- You have a service that you want to expose.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create a secret for the destination CA certificate by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create secret generic dest-ca-cert --from-file=tls.crt=<file_path>
    ```

    For example:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc -n test-ns create secret generic dest-ca-cert --from-file=tls.crt=tls.crt

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    ``` terminal

2.  Add the `route.openshift.io/destination-ca-certificate-secret` to the Ingress annotations:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:

        route.openshift.io/termination: "reencrypt"

    ```

    where:

    `destination-ca-certificate-secret`
    Specifies the `route.openshift.io/destination-ca-certificate-secret` annotation. The annotation references a Kubernetes secret.

    The Ingress Controller inserts a secret that is referenced in the annotation into the generated route.

# Creating a route with externally managed certificates

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can configure OpenShift Container Platform routes with third-party certificate management solutions by using the `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field of the route API. You can reference externally managed TLS certificates via secrets, eliminating the need for manual certificate management.

</div>

By using the externally managed certificate, you can reduce errors to ensure a smoother rollout of certificate updates and enable the OpenShift router to serve renewed certificates promptly. You can use externally managed certificates with both edge routes and re-encrypt routes.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You must have a secret containing a valid certificate or key pair in PEM-encoded format of type `kubernetes.io/tls`, which includes both `tls.key` and `tls.crt` keys. Example command: `$ oc create secret tls myapp-tls --cert=server.crt --key=server.key`.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create a `role` object in the same namespace as the secret to allow the router service account read access by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create role secret-reader --verb=get,list,watch --resource=secrets --resource-name=<secret-name> \
    --namespace=<current-namespace>
    ```

    - `<secret-name>`: Specify the actual name of your secret.

    - `<current-namespace>`: Specify the namespace where both your secret and route reside.

2.  Create a `rolebinding` object in the same namespace as the secret and bind the router service account to the newly created role by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create rolebinding secret-reader-binding --role=secret-reader --serviceaccount=openshift-ingress:router --namespace=<current-namespace>
    ```

    - `<current-namespace>`: Specify the namespace where both your secret and route reside.

3.  Create a YAML file that defines the `route` and specifies the secret containing your certificate using the following example.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    YAML definition of the secure route

        [...]
    [...]
    ```

    </div>

    - `<secret-name>`: Specify the actual name of your secret.

4.  Create a `route` resource by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc apply -f <route.yaml>
    ```

    - `<route.yaml>`: Specify the generated YAML filename.

      If the secret exists and has a certificate/key pair, the router will serve the generated certificate if all prerequisites are met.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` is not provided, the router uses default generated certificates.
      >
      > You cannot provide the `.spec.tls.certificate` field or the `.spec.tls.key` field when using the `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field.
