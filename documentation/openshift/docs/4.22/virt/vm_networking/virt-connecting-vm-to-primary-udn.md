<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to a user-defined network (UDN) on the VM’s primary interface by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI. The primary user-defined network replaces the default pod network in your specified namespace. Unlike the pod network, you can define the primary UDN per project, where each project can use its specific subnet and topology.

</div>

OpenShift Virtualization supports the namespace-scoped `UserDefinedNetwork` and the cluster-scoped `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource definitions (CRD).

Cluster administrators can configure a primary `UserDefinedNetwork` CRD to create a tenant network that isolates the tenant namespace from other namespaces without requiring network policies. Additionally, cluster administrators can use the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CRD to create a shared OVN network across multiple namespaces.

> [!NOTE]
> You must add the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label when you create a namespace that is to be used with user-defined networks.

With the layer 2 topology, OVN-Kubernetes creates an overlay network between nodes. You can use this overlay network to connect VMs on different nodes without having to configure any additional physical networking infrastructure.

The layer 2 topology enables seamless migration of VMs without the need for Network Address Translation (NAT) because persistent IP addresses are preserved across cluster nodes during live migration.

You must consider the following limitations before implementing a primary UDN:

- You cannot use the `virtctl ssh` command to configure SSH access to a VM.

- You cannot use the `oc port-forward` command to forward ports to a VM.

- You cannot use headless services to access a VM.

# Create a primary user-defined network by using the web console

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform web console to create a primary namespace-scoped `UserDefinedNetwork` or a cluster-scoped `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource definition (CRD). The UDN serves as the default primary network for pods and VMs that you create in namespaces associated with the network.

</div>

After you define the custom primary overlay network, you can create namespaces that are associated with the cluster-scoped UDN.

1.  Create a `Namespace` object as a YAML file similar to the following example:

      labels:
        k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network: ""

    The `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label is required for the namespace to be associated with a UDN. If the namespace is to be used with an existing cluster UDN, you must also add the appropriate labels that are defined in the `spec.namespaceSelector` field of the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource.

1.  Create a `UserDefinedNetwork` object to specify the custom network configuration.

    Example `UserDefinedNetwork` manifest:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
    kind: UserDefinedNetwork
    metadata:
      name: udn-l2-net
      namespace: my-namespace
    spec:
      topology: Layer2
      layer2:
        role: Primary
        subnets:
          - "10.0.0.0/24"
          - "2001:db8::/60"
        ipam:
          lifecycle: Persistent
    ```

    - `metadata.name` specifies the name of the `UserDefinedNetwork` custom resource.

    - `metadata.namespace` specifies the namespace in which the VM is located. The namespace must have the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label. The namespace must not be `default`, an `openshift-*` namespace, or match any global namespaces that are defined by the Cluster Network Operator (CNO).

    - `spec.topology` specifies the topological configuration of the network. The required value is `Layer2`. A `Layer2` topology creates a logical switch that is shared by all nodes.

    - `spec.layer2.role` specifies whether the UDN is primary or secondary. The `Primary` role means that the UDN acts as the primary network for the VM and all default traffic passes through this network.

    - `spec.layer2.ipam.lifecycle` specifies that virtual workloads have consistent IP addresses across reboots and migration. The `spec.layer2.subnets` field is required when `ipam.lifecycle: Persistent` is specified.

2.  Apply the `UserDefinedNetwork` manifest by running the following command:

    ``` terminal

    - `metadata.name` specifies the name of the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource.

    - `spec.namespaceSelector` specifies the set of namespaces that the cluster UDN applies to. The namespace selector must not point to `default`, an `openshift-*` namespace, or any global namespaces that are defined by the Cluster Network Operator (CNO).

    - `spec.namespaceSelector.matchExpressions` specifies the type of selector. In this example, the `matchExpressions` selector selects objects that have the label `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` with the value `red-namespace` or `blue-namespace`.

    - `spec.namespaceSelector.matchExpressions.operator` specifies the type of operator. Possible values are `In`, `NotIn`, and `Exists`.

    - `spec.network.topology` specifies the topological configuration of the network. The required value is `Layer2`. A `Layer2` topology creates a logical switch that is shared by all nodes.

    - `spec.network.layer2.role` specifies whether the UDN is primary or secondary. The `Primary` role means that the UDN acts as the primary network for the VM and all default traffic passes through this network.

# Attach a virtual machine to the primary user-defined network

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to the primary user-defined network (UDN) by requesting the pod network attachment and configuring the interface binding.

</div>

OpenShift Virtualization supports the following network binding plugins to connect the network interface to the VM:

Layer 2 bridge
The Layer 2 bridge binding creates a direct Layer 2 connection between the VM’s virtual interface and the virtual switch of the UDN.

Passt
The Plug a Simple Socket Transport (passt) binding provides a user-space networking solution that integrates seamlessly with the pod network, providing better integration with the OpenShift Container Platform networking ecosystem.

Passt binding has the following benefits:

- You can define readiness and liveness HTTP probes to configure VM health checks.

- You can use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security to monitor TCP traffic within the cluster with detailed insights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the passt binding plugin to attach a VM to the primary UDN is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

## Attaching a virtual machine to the primary user-defined network by using the web console

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to the primary user-defined network (UDN) by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console. VMs that are created in a namespace where the primary UDN is configured are automatically attached to the UDN with the Layer 2 bridge network binding plugin.

To attach a VM to the primary UDN by using the Plug a Simple Socket Transport (passt) binding, enable the plugin and configure the VM network interface in the web console.

    kind: VirtualMachine
    metadata:
