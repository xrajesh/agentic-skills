Back up and restore virtual machines by using the [OpenShift API for Data Protection](../../backup_and_restore/index.xml#application-backup-restore-operations-overview).

You can install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with OpenShift Virtualization by installing the OADP Operator and configuring a backup location. You can then install the Data Protection Application.

> [!NOTE]
> OpenShift API for Data Protection with OpenShift Virtualization supports the following backup and restore storage options:
>
> - Container Storage Interface (CSI) backups
>
> - Container Storage Interface (CSI) backups with DataMover
>
> The following storage options are excluded:
>
> - File system backup and restore
>
> - Volume snapshot backup and restore
>
> For more information, see [Backing up applications with File System Backup: Kopia or Restic](../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc.xml#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc).

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default software catalog sources and mirror the Operator catalog.

See [Using Operator Lifecycle Manager in disconnected environments](../../disconnected/using-olm.xml#olm-restricted-networks) for details.

# Installing and configuring OADP with OpenShift Virtualization

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

As a cluster administrator, you install OADP by installing the OADP Operator.

</div>

The latest version of the OADP Operator installs [Velero 1.16](https://velero.io/docs/v1.16).

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Install the OADP Operator according to the instructions for your storage provider.

2.  Install the Data Protection Application (DPA) with the `kubevirt` and `openshift` OADP plugins.

3.  Back up virtual machines by creating a `Backup` custom resource (CR).

    > [!WARNING]
    > Red Hat support is limited to only the following options:
    >
    > - CSI backups
    >
    > - CSI backups with DataMover.

    You restore the `Backup` CR by creating a `Restore` CR.

# Installing the Data Protection Application

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You install the Data Protection Application (DPA) by creating an instance of the `DataProtectionApplication` API.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You must install the OADP Operator.

- You must configure object storage as a backup location.

- If you use snapshots to back up PVs, your cloud provider must support either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.

- If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, you must create a `Secret` with the default name, `cloud-credentials`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you do not want to specify backup or snapshot locations during the installation, you can create a default `Secret` with an empty `credentials-velero` file. If there is no default `Secret`, the installation will fail.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Click **Ecosystem** → **Installed Operators** and select the OADP Operator.

2.  Under **Provided APIs**, click **Create instance** in the **DataProtectionApplication** box.

3.  Click **YAML View** and update the parameters of the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: DataProtectionApplication
    metadata:
      name: <dpa_sample>
      namespace: openshift-adp
    spec:
      configuration:
        velero:
          defaultPlugins:
            - kubevirt
            - gcp
            - csi
            - openshift
          resourceTimeout: 10m
        nodeAgent:
          enable: true
          uploaderType: kopia
          podConfig:
            nodeSelector: <node_selector>
      backupLocations:
        - velero:
            provider: gcp
            default: true
            credential:
              key: cloud
              name: <default_secret>
            objectStorage:
              bucket: <bucket_name>
              prefix: <prefix>
    ```

    where:

    `namespace`
    Specifies the default namespace for OADP which is `openshift-adp`. The namespace is a variable and is configurable.

    `kubevirt`
    Specifies that the `kubevirt` plugin is mandatory for OpenShift Virtualization.

    `gcp`
    Specifies the plugin for the backup provider, for example, `gcp`, if it exists.

    `csi`
    Specifies that the `csi` plugin is mandatory for backing up PVs with CSI snapshots. The `csi` plugin uses the [Velero CSI beta snapshot APIs](https://velero.io/docs/main/csi/). You do not need to configure a snapshot location.

    `openshift`
    Specifies that the `openshift` plugin is mandatory.

    `resourceTimeout`
    Specifies how many minutes to wait for several Velero resources such as Velero CRD availability, volumeSnapshot deletion, and backup repository availability, before timeout occurs. The default is 10m.

    `nodeAgent`
    Specifies the administrative agent that routes the administrative requests to servers.

    `enable`
    Set this value to `true` if you want to enable `nodeAgent` and perform File System Backup.

    `uploaderType`
    Specifies the uploader type. Enter `kopia` as your uploader to use the Built-in DataMover. The `nodeAgent` deploys a daemon set, which means that the `nodeAgent` pods run on each working node. You can configure File System Backup by adding `spec.defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true` to the `Backup` CR.

    `nodeSelector`
    Specifies the nodes on which Kopia are available. By default, Kopia runs on all nodes.

    `provider`
    Specifies the backup provider.

    `name`
    Specifies the correct default name for the `Secret`, for example, `cloud-credentials-gcp`, if you use a default plugin for the backup provider. If specifying a custom name, then the custom name is used for the backup location. If you do not specify a `Secret` name, the default name is used.

    `bucket`
    Specifies a bucket as the backup storage location. If the bucket is not a dedicated bucket for Velero backups, you must specify a prefix.

    `prefix`
    Specifies a prefix for Velero backups, for example, `velero`, if the bucket is used for multiple purposes.

4.  Click **Create**.

2.  Verify that the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) is reconciled by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get dpa dpa-sample -n openshift-adp -o jsonpath=''
    ```

    ``` yaml
    {"conditions":[{"lastTransitionTime":"2023-10-27T01:23:57Z","message":"Reconcile complete","reason":"Complete","status":"True","type":"Reconciled"}]}
    ```

3.  Verify the `type` is set to `Reconciled`.

4.  Verify the backup storage location and confirm that the `PHASE` is `Available` by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
    ```

    ``` yaml
    NAME           PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE     DEFAULT
    dpa-sample-1   Available   1s               3d16h   true
