# About dedicated resources

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

When you enable dedicated resources for your virtual machine, your virtual machine’s workload is scheduled on CPUs that will not be used by other processes.

</div>

By using dedicated resources, you can improve the performance of the virtual machine and the accuracy of latency predictions.
