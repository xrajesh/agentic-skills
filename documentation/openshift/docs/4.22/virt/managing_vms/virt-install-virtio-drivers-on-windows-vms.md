VirtIO drivers are paravirtualized device drivers required for Microsoft Windows virtual machines (VMs) to run in OpenShift Virtualization. The drivers are shipped with the rest of the images and do not require a separate download.

</div>

The `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk must be attached to the VM as a SATA CD drive to enable driver installation. You can install VirtIO drivers during Windows installation or add them to an existing Windows installation.

After the drivers are installed, the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk can be removed from the VM.

| Driver name | Hardware ID | Description |
|----|----|----|
| **viostor** | VEN_1AF4&DEV_1001, VEN_1AF4&DEV_1042 | The block driver. Sometimes labeled as an **SCSI Controller** in the **Other devices** group. |
| **viorng** | VEN_1AF4&DEV_1005, VEN_1AF4&DEV_1044 | The entropy source driver. Sometimes labeled as a **PCI Device** in the **Other devices** group. |
| **NetKVM** | VEN_1AF4&DEV_1000, VEN_1AF4&DEV_1041 | The network driver. Sometimes labeled as an **Ethernet Controller** in the **Other devices** group. Available only if a VirtIO NIC is configured. |

# Installing VirtIO drivers from a container disk added as a SATA CD drive

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can install VirtIO drivers from a container disk that you add to a Windows virtual machine (VM) as a SATA CD drive.

</div>

> [!TIP]
> Downloading the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk from the [Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?q=virtio-win&p=1) is not mandatory, because the container disk is downloaded from the Red Hat registry if it not already present in the cluster. However, downloading reduces the installation time.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You must have access to the Red Hat registry or to the downloaded `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk in a restricted environment.

- You have installed the `virtctl` CLI.

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Add the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk as a CD drive by editing the `VirtualMachine` manifest:

    ``` yaml
    # ...
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          disks:
            - name: virtiocontainerdisk
              bootOrder: 2
              cdrom:
                bus: sata
    volumes:
      - containerDisk:
          image: container-native-virtualization/virtio-win
        name: virtiocontainerdisk
    ```

    OpenShift Virtualization boots the VM disks in the order defined in the `VirtualMachine` manifest. You can either define other VM disks that boot before the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk, or use the optional `bootOrder` parameter to ensure the VM boots from the correct disk. If you configure the boot order for a disk, you must configure the boot order for the other disks.

2.  Apply the changes:

    - If the VM is not running, run the following command:

      ``` terminal
      $ virtctl start <vm> -n <namespace>
      ```

    - If the VM is running, reboot the VM or run the following command:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc apply -f <vm.yaml>
      ```

3.  After the VM has started, install the VirtIO drivers from the SATA CD drive.

# Installing VirtIO drivers during Windows installation

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can install the VirtIO drivers while installing Windows on a virtual machine (VM).

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure uses a generic approach to the Windows installation and the installation method might differ between versions of Windows. See the documentation for the version of Windows that you are installing.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- A storage device containing the `virtio` drivers must be attached to the VM.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  In the Windows operating system, use the `File Explorer` to navigate to the `virtio-win` CD drive.

2.  Double-click the drive to run the appropriate installer for your VM.

    For a 64-bit vCPU, select the `virtio-win-gt-x64` installer. 32-bit vCPUs are no longer supported.

3.  Optional: During the **Custom Setup** step of the installer, select the device drivers you want to install. The recommended driver set is selected by default.

4.  After the installation is complete, select **Finish**.

5.  Reboot the VM.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

1.  Open the system disk on the PC. This is typically `C:`.

2.  Navigate to **Program Files** → **Virtio-Win**.

</div>

If the **Virtio-Win** directory is present and contains a sub-directory for each driver, the installation was successful.
