# Enable automatic updates for Red Hat virtio-win drivers

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

If the Windows Update service (WUS) is restricted to allow only drivers explicitly signed and published by Microsoft, automatic Red Hat `virtio-win` driver updates are disabled. You must manually complete the required configuration steps to enable automatic updates for Red Hat `virtio-win` drivers on a Windows virtual machine (VM).

Procedure

</div>

1.  Import the Red Hat Release Certificate into the Trusted Publishers store.

    Example command:

    ``` powershell
    Import-Certificate -FilePath "redhat-driver-cert.cer" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPublisher
    ```

2.  In the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC):

    1.  Set the `Allow signed updates from an intranet Microsoft update service location` policy to `Enabled`.

        If a driver is signed by a certificate in the Trusted Publishers store, it is now accepted, even if it didn’t come from Microsoft directly.

    2.  Set the `Do not include drivers with Windows Updates` policy to `Disabled`.
