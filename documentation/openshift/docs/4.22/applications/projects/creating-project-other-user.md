Impersonation allows you to create a project as a different user.

# API impersonation

You can configure a request to the OpenShift Container Platform API to act as though it originated from another user. For more information, see [User impersonation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation) in the Kubernetes documentation.

# Impersonating a user when you create a project

You can impersonate a different user when you create a project request. Because `system:authenticated:oauth` is the only bootstrap group that can create project requests, you must impersonate that group.
