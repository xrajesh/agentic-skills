As an administrator, you can use groups to manage users, change their permissions, and enhance collaboration. Your organization may have already created user groups and stored them in an LDAP server. OpenShift Container Platform can sync those LDAP records with internal OpenShift Container Platform records, enabling you to manage your groups in one place. OpenShift Container Platform currently supports group sync with LDAP servers using three common schemas for defining group membership: RFC 2307, Active Directory, and augmented Active Directory.

For more information on configuring LDAP, see [Configuring an LDAP identity provider](../authentication/identity_providers/configuring-ldap-identity-provider.xml#configuring-ldap-identity-provider).

> [!NOTE]
> You must have `cluster-admin` privileges to sync groups.

# About configuring LDAP sync

Before you can run LDAP sync, you need a sync configuration file. This file contains the following LDAP client configuration details:

- Configuration for connecting to your LDAP server.

- Sync configuration options that are dependent on the schema used in your LDAP server.

- An administrator-defined list of name mappings that maps OpenShift Container Platform group names to groups in your LDAP server.

The format of the configuration file depends upon the schema you are using: RFC 2307, Active Directory, or augmented Active Directory.

LDAP client configuration
The LDAP client configuration section of the configuration defines the connections to your LDAP server.

The LDAP client configuration section of the configuration defines the connections to your LDAP server.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

LDAP client configuration

</div>

``` yaml
url: ldap://10.0.0.0:389
bindDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
bindPassword: <password>
insecure: false
ca: my-ldap-ca-bundle.crt
```

</div>

- The connection protocol, IP address of the LDAP server hosting your database, and the port to connect to, formatted as `scheme://host:port`.

- Optional distinguished name (DN) to use as the Bind DN. OpenShift Container Platform uses this if elevated privilege is required to retrieve entries for the sync operation.

- Optional password to use to bind. OpenShift Container Platform uses this if elevated privilege is necessary to retrieve entries for the sync operation. This value may also be provided in an environment variable, external file, or encrypted file.

- When `false`, secure LDAP (`ldaps://`) URLs connect using TLS, and insecure LDAP (`ldap://`) URLs are upgraded to TLS. When `true`, no TLS connection is made to the server and you cannot use `ldaps://` URL schemes.

- The certificate bundle to use for validating server certificates for the configured URL. If empty, OpenShift Container Platform uses system-trusted roots. This only applies if `insecure` is set to `false`.

LDAP query definition
Sync configurations consist of LDAP query definitions for the entries that are required for synchronization. The specific definition of an LDAP query depends on the schema used to store membership information in the LDAP server.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

LDAP query definition

</div>

``` yaml
baseDN: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
scope: sub
derefAliases: never
timeout: 0
filter: (objectClass=person)
pageSize: 0
```

</div>

- The distinguished name (DN) of the branch of the directory where all searches will start from. It is required that you specify the top of your directory tree, but you can also specify a subtree in the directory.

- The scope of the search. Valid values are `base`, `one`, or `sub`. If this is left undefined, then a scope of `sub` is assumed. Descriptions of the scope options can be found in the table below.

- The behavior of the search with respect to aliases in the LDAP tree. Valid values are `never`, `search`, `base`, or `always`. If this is left undefined, then the default is to `always` dereference aliases. Descriptions of the dereferencing behaviors can be found in the table below.

- The time limit allowed for the search by the client, in seconds. A value of `0` imposes no client-side limit.

- A valid LDAP search filter. If this is left undefined, then the default is `(objectClass=*)`.

- The optional maximum size of response pages from the server, measured in LDAP entries. If set to `0`, no size restrictions will be made on pages of responses. Setting paging sizes is necessary when queries return more entries than the client or server allow by default.

| LDAP search scope | Description |
|----|----|
| `base` | Only consider the object specified by the base DN given for the query. |
| `one` | Consider all of the objects on the same level in the tree as the base DN for the query. |
| `sub` | Consider the entire subtree rooted at the base DN given for the query. |

LDAP search scope options {#ldap-search}

| Dereferencing behavior | Description |
|----|----|
| `never` | Never dereference any aliases found in the LDAP tree. |
| `search` | Only dereference aliases found while searching. |
| `base` | Only dereference aliases while finding the base object. |
| `always` | Always dereference all aliases found in the LDAP tree. |

LDAP dereferencing behaviors {#deref-aliases}

User-defined name mapping
A user-defined name mapping explicitly maps the names of OpenShift Container Platform groups to unique identifiers that find groups on your LDAP server. The mapping uses normal YAML syntax. A user-defined mapping can contain an entry for every group in your LDAP server or only a subset of those groups. If there are groups on the LDAP server that do not have a user-defined name mapping, the default behavior during sync is to use the attribute specified as the OpenShift Container Platform group’s name.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

User-defined name mapping

</div>

``` yaml
groupUIDNameMapping:
  "cn=group1,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": firstgroup
  "cn=group2,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": secondgroup
  "cn=group3,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": thirdgroup
```

</div>

## About the RFC 2307 configuration file

The RFC 2307 schema requires you to provide an LDAP query definition for both user and group entries, as well as the attributes with which to represent them in the internal OpenShift Container Platform records.

For clarity, the group you create in OpenShift Container Platform should use attributes other than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing fields. For example, identify the users of an OpenShift Container Platform group by their e-mail, and use the name of the group as the common name. The following configuration file creates these relationships:

> [!NOTE]
> If using user-defined name mappings, your configuration file will differ.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

LDAP sync configuration that uses RFC 2307 schema: `rfc2307_config.yaml`

- The IP address and host of the LDAP server where this group’s record is stored.

- When `false`, secure LDAP (`ldaps://`) URLs connect using TLS, and insecure LDAP (`ldap://`) URLs are upgraded to TLS. When `true`, no TLS connection is made to the server and you cannot use `ldaps://` URL schemes.

- The attribute that uniquely identifies a group on the LDAP server. You cannot specify `groupsQuery` filters when using DN for `groupUIDAttribute`. For fine-grained filtering, use the whitelist / blacklist method.

- The attribute to use as the name of the group.

- The attribute on the group that stores the membership information.

- The attribute that uniquely identifies a user on the LDAP server. You cannot specify `usersQuery` filters when using DN for userUIDAttribute. For fine-grained filtering, use the whitelist / blacklist method.

- The attribute to use as the name of the user in the OpenShift Container Platform group record.

## About the Active Directory configuration file

The Active Directory schema requires you to provide an LDAP query definition for user entries, as well as the attributes to represent them with in the internal OpenShift Container Platform group records.

For clarity, the group you create in OpenShift Container Platform should use attributes other than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing fields. For example, identify the users of an OpenShift Container Platform group by their e-mail, but define the name of the group by the name of the group on the LDAP server. The following configuration file creates these relationships:

# Running LDAP sync

Once you have created a sync configuration file, you can begin to sync. OpenShift Container Platform allows administrators to perform a number of different sync types with the same server.

## Syncing the LDAP server with OpenShift Container Platform

You can sync all groups from the LDAP server with OpenShift Container Platform.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Create a sync configuration file.

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To sync all groups from the LDAP server with OpenShift Container Platform:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc adm groups sync --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > By default, all group synchronization operations are dry-run, so you must set the `--confirm` flag on the `oc adm groups sync` command to make changes to OpenShift Container Platform group records.

# Running a group pruning job

An administrator can also choose to remove groups from OpenShift Container Platform records if the records on the LDAP server that created them are no longer present. The prune job will accept the same sync configuration file and whitelists or blacklists as used for the sync job.

For example:

``` terminal
$ oc adm prune groups --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm
```

``` terminal
$ oc adm prune groups --whitelist=/path/to/whitelist.txt --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm
```

``` terminal
$ oc adm prune groups --blacklist=/path/to/blacklist.txt --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm
```

# Automatically syncing LDAP groups

You can automatically sync LDAP groups on a periodic basis by configuring a cron job.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have configured an LDAP identity provider (IDP).

  This procedure assumes that you created an LDAP secret named `ldap-secret` and a config map named `ca-config-map`.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create a project where the cron job will run:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc new-project ldap-sync
    ```

    - This procedure uses a project called `ldap-sync`.

2.  Locate the secret and config map that you created when configuring the LDAP identity provider and copy them to this new project.

    The secret and config map exist in the `openshift-config` project and must be copied to the new `ldap-sync` project.

3.  Define a service account:

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example `ldap-sync-service-account.yaml`

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    kind: ServiceAccount
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: ldap-group-syncer
      namespace: ldap-sync
    ```

    </div>

4.  Create the service account:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f ldap-sync-service-account.yaml
    ```

5.  Define a cluster role:

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example `ldap-sync-cluster-role.yaml`

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: ldap-group-syncer
    rules:
      - apiGroups:
          - user.openshift.io
        resources:
          - groups
        verbs:
          - get
          - list
          - create
          - update
    ```

    </div>

6.  Create the cluster role:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f ldap-sync-cluster-role.yaml
    ```

7.  Define a cluster role binding to bind the cluster role to the service account:

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example `ldap-sync-cluster-role-binding.yaml`

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: ldap-group-syncer
    subjects:
      - kind: ServiceAccount
        name: ldap-group-syncer
        namespace: ldap-sync
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: ldap-group-syncer
    ```

    </div>

    - Reference to the service account created earlier in this procedure.

    - Reference to the cluster role created earlier in this procedure.

8.  Create the cluster role binding:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f ldap-sync-cluster-role-binding.yaml
    ```

9.  Define a config map that specifies the sync configuration file:

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example `ldap-sync-config-map.yaml`

    </div>

    ``` yaml

        bindPassword:
          file: "/etc/secrets/bindPassword"
        ca: /etc/ldap-ca/ca.crt
        rfc2307:
          groupsQuery:
            baseDN: "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
            scope: sub
            filter: "(objectClass=groupOfMembers)"
            derefAliases: never
            pageSize: 0
          groupUIDAttribute: dn
          groupNameAttributes: [ cn ]
          groupMembershipAttributes: [ member ]
          usersQuery:
            baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"

            derefAliases: never
            pageSize: 0
          userUIDAttribute: dn
          userNameAttributes: [ uid ]
          tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: false
          tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: false
    ```

    </div>

    - Define the sync configuration file.

    - Specify the URL.

    - Specify the `bindDN`.

    - This example uses the RFC2307 schema; adjust values as necessary. You can also use a different schema.

    - Specify the `baseDN` for `groupsQuery`.

    - Specify the `baseDN` for `usersQuery`.

10. Create the config map:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f ldap-sync-config-map.yaml
    ```

11. Define a cron job:

    - Configure the settings for the cron job. See "Creating cron jobs" for more information on cron job settings.

    - The schedule for the job specified in [cron format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). This example cron job runs every 30 minutes. Adjust the frequency as necessary, making sure to take into account how long the sync takes to run.

    - How long, in seconds, to keep finished jobs. This should match the period of the job schedule in order to clean old failed jobs and prevent unnecessary alerts. For more information, see [TTL-after-finished Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/ttlafterfinished) in the Kubernetes documentation.

    - The LDAP sync command for the cron job to run. Passes in the sync configuration file that was defined in the config map.

# LDAP group sync examples

This section contains examples for the RFC 2307, Active Directory, and augmented Active Directory schemas.

> [!NOTE]
> These examples assume that all users are direct members of their respective groups. Specifically, no groups have other groups as members. See the Nested Membership Sync Example for information on how to sync nested groups.

## Syncing groups using the RFC 2307 schema

For the RFC 2307 schema, the following examples synchronize a group named `admins` that has two members: `Jane` and `Jim`. The examples explain:

- How the group and users are added to the LDAP server.

- What the resulting group record in OpenShift Container Platform will be after synchronization.

> [!NOTE]
> These examples assume that all users are direct members of their respective groups. Specifically, no groups have other groups as members. See the Nested Membership Sync Example for information on how to sync nested groups.

In the RFC 2307 schema, both users (Jane and Jim) and groups exist on the LDAP server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored in attributes on the group. The following snippet of `ldif` defines the users and group for this schema:

## Syncing groups using RFC 2307 with user-defined error tolerances

By default, if the groups being synced contain members whose entries are outside of the scope defined in the member query, the group sync fails with an error:

    Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with dn="<user-dn>" would search outside of the base dn specified (dn="<base-dn>")".

This often indicates a misconfigured `baseDN` in the `usersQuery` field. However, in cases where the `baseDN` intentionally does not contain some of the members of the group, setting `tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: true` allows the group sync to continue. Out of scope members will be ignored.

Similarly, when the group sync process fails to locate a member for a group, it fails outright with errors:

    Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with base dn="<user-dn>" refers to a non-existent entry".
    Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with base dn="<user-dn>" and filter "<filter>" did not return any results".

This often indicates a misconfigured `usersQuery` field. However, in cases where the group contains member entries that are known to be missing, setting `tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: true` allows the group sync to continue. Problematic members will be ignored.

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling error tolerances for the LDAP group sync causes the sync process to ignore problematic member entries. If the LDAP group sync is not configured correctly, this could result in synced OpenShift Container Platform groups missing members.

### LDAP nested membership sync example

Groups in OpenShift Container Platform do not nest. The LDAP server must flatten group membership before the data can be consumed. Microsoft’s Active Directory Server supports this feature via the `LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN` rule, which has the OID `1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941`. Furthermore, only explicitly whitelisted groups can be synced when using this matching rule.

This section has an example for the augmented Active Directory schema, which synchronizes a group named `admins` that has one user `Jane` and one group `otheradmins` as members. The `otheradmins` group has one user member: `Jim`. This example explains:

- How the group and users are added to the LDAP server.

- What the LDAP sync configuration file looks like.

- What the resulting group record in OpenShift Container Platform will be after synchronization.

In the augmented Active Directory schema, both users (`Jane` and `Jim`) and groups exist in the LDAP server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored in attributes on the user or the group. The following snippet of `ldif` defines the users and groups for this schema:

<div class="formalpara">

```

</div>

- The user’s and group’s memberships are listed as attributes on the object.

- The groups are first-class entries on the LDAP server.

- The `otheradmins` group is a member of the `admins` group.

When syncing nested groups with Active Directory, you must provide an LDAP query definition for both user entries and group entries, as well as the attributes with which to represent them in the internal OpenShift Container Platform group records. Furthermore, certain changes are required in this configuration:

- The `oc adm groups sync` command must explicitly whitelist groups.

- The user’s `groupMembershipAttributes` must include `"memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:"` to comply with the `LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN` rule.

- The `groupUIDAttribute` must be set to `dn`.

- The `groupsQuery`:

  - Must not set `filter`.

  - Must set a valid `derefAliases`.

  - Should not set `baseDN` as that value is ignored.

  - Should not set `scope` as that value is ignored.

For clarity, the group you create in OpenShift Container Platform should use attributes other than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing fields. For example, identify the users of an OpenShift Container Platform group by their e-mail, and use the name of the group as the common name. The following configuration file creates these relationships:

# LDAP sync configuration specification

The object specification for the configuration file is below. Note that the different schema objects have different fields. For example, v1.ActiveDirectoryConfig has no `groupsQuery` field whereas v1.RFC2307Config and v1.AugmentedActiveDirectoryConfig both do.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is no support for binary attributes. All attribute data coming from the LDAP server must be in the format of a UTF-8 encoded string. For example, never use a binary attribute, such as `objectGUID`, as an ID attribute. You must use string attributes, such as `sAMAccountName` or `userPrincipalName`, instead.

## v1.LDAPSyncConfig

`LDAPSyncConfig` holds the necessary configuration options to define an LDAP group sync.

| `rfc2307` | Holds the configuration for extracting data from an LDAP server set up in a fashion similar to RFC2307: first-class group and user entries, with group membership determined by a multi-valued attribute on the group entry listing its members. | v1.RFC2307Config |
| `activeDirectory` | Holds the configuration for extracting data from an LDAP server set up in a fashion similar to that used in Active Directory: first-class user entries, with group membership determined by a multi-valued attribute on members listing groups they are a member of. | v1.ActiveDirectoryConfig |
| `augmentedActiveDirectory` | Holds the configuration for extracting data from an LDAP server set up in a fashion similar to that used in Active Directory as described above, with one addition: first-class group entries exist and are used to hold metadata but not group membership. | v1.AugmentedActiveDirectoryConfig |

## v1.StringSource

`StringSource` allows specifying a string inline, or externally via environment variable or file. When it contains only a string value, it marshals to a simple JSON string.

| Name | Description | Schema |
|----|----|----|
| `value` | Specifies the cleartext value, or an encrypted value if `keyFile` is specified. | string |
| `env` | Specifies an environment variable containing the cleartext value, or an encrypted value if the `keyFile` is specified. | string |
| `file` | References a file containing the cleartext value, or an encrypted value if a `keyFile` is specified. | string |
| `keyFile` | References a file containing the key to use to decrypt the value. | string |

## v1.LDAPQuery

`LDAPQuery` holds the options necessary to build an LDAP query.

| Name | Description | Schema |
|----|----|----|
| `baseDN` | DN of the branch of the directory where all searches should start from. | string |
| `scope` | The optional scope of the search. Can be `base`: only the base object, `one`: all objects on the base level, `sub`: the entire subtree. Defaults to `sub` if not set. | string |
| `derefAliases` | The optional behavior of the search with regards to aliases. Can be `never`: never dereference aliases, `search`: only dereference in searching, `base`: only dereference in finding the base object, `always`: always dereference. Defaults to `always` if not set. | string |
| `timeout` | Holds the limit of time in seconds that any request to the server can remain outstanding before the wait for a response is given up. If this is `0`, no client-side limit is imposed. | integer |
| `filter` | A valid LDAP search filter that retrieves all relevant entries from the LDAP server with the base DN. | string |
| `pageSize` | Maximum preferred page size, measured in LDAP entries. A page size of `0` means no paging will be done. | integer |

## v1.RFC2307Config

`RFC2307Config` holds the necessary configuration options to define how an LDAP group sync interacts with an LDAP server using the RFC2307 schema.

| Name | Description | Schema |
|----|----|----|
| `groupsQuery` | Holds the template for an LDAP query that returns group entries. | v1.LDAPQuery |
| `groupUIDAttribute` | Defines which attribute on an LDAP group entry will be interpreted as its unique identifier. (`ldapGroupUID`) | string |
| `groupNameAttributes` | Defines which attributes on an LDAP group entry will be interpreted as its name to use for an OpenShift Container Platform group. | string array |
| `groupMembershipAttributes` | Defines which attributes on an LDAP group entry will be interpreted as its members. The values contained in those attributes must be queryable by your `UserUIDAttribute`. | string array |
| `usersQuery` | Holds the template for an LDAP query that returns user entries. | v1.LDAPQuery |
| `userUIDAttribute` | Defines which attribute on an LDAP user entry will be interpreted as its unique identifier. It must correspond to values that will be found from the `GroupMembershipAttributes`. | string |
| `userNameAttributes` | Defines which attributes on an LDAP user entry will be used, in order, as its OpenShift Container Platform user name. The first attribute with a non-empty value is used. This should match your `PreferredUsername` setting for your `LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider`. The attribute to use as the name of the user in the OpenShift Container Platform group record. `mail` or `sAMAccountName` are preferred choices in most installations. | string array |
| `tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors` | Determines the behavior of the LDAP sync job when missing user entries are encountered. If `true`, an LDAP query for users that does not find any will be tolerated and an only and error will be logged. If `false`, the LDAP sync job will fail if a query for users does not find any. The default value is `false`. Misconfigured LDAP sync jobs with this flag set to `true` can cause group membership to be removed, so it is recommended to use this flag with caution. | boolean |
| `tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors` | Determines the behavior of the LDAP sync job when out-of-scope user entries are encountered. If `true`, an LDAP query for a user that falls outside of the base DN given for the all user query will be tolerated and only an error will be logged. If `false`, the LDAP sync job will fail if a user query would search outside of the base DN specified by the all user query. Misconfigured LDAP sync jobs with this flag set to `true` can result in groups missing users, so it is recommended to use this flag with caution. | boolean |

## v1.ActiveDirectoryConfig

`ActiveDirectoryConfig` holds the necessary configuration options to define how an LDAP group sync interacts with an LDAP server using the Active Directory schema.

| Name | Description | Schema |
|----|----|----|
| `usersQuery` | Holds the template for an LDAP query that returns user entries. | v1.LDAPQuery |
| `userNameAttributes` | Defines which attributes on an LDAP user entry will be interpreted as its OpenShift Container Platform user name. The attribute to use as the name of the user in the OpenShift Container Platform group record. `mail` or `sAMAccountName` are preferred choices in most installations. | string array |
| `groupMembershipAttributes` | Defines which attributes on an LDAP user entry will be interpreted as the groups it is a member of. | string array |

## v1.AugmentedActiveDirectoryConfig

`AugmentedActiveDirectoryConfig` holds the necessary configuration options to define how an LDAP group sync interacts with an LDAP server using the augmented Active Directory schema.

| Name | Description | Schema |
|----|----|----|
| `usersQuery` | Holds the template for an LDAP query that returns user entries. | v1.LDAPQuery |
| `userNameAttributes` | Defines which attributes on an LDAP user entry will be interpreted as its OpenShift Container Platform user name. The attribute to use as the name of the user in the OpenShift Container Platform group record. `mail` or `sAMAccountName` are preferred choices in most installations. | string array |
| `groupMembershipAttributes` | Defines which attributes on an LDAP user entry will be interpreted as the groups it is a member of. | string array |
| `groupsQuery` | Holds the template for an LDAP query that returns group entries. | v1.LDAPQuery |
| `groupUIDAttribute` | Defines which attribute on an LDAP group entry will be interpreted as its unique identifier. (`ldapGroupUID`) | string |
