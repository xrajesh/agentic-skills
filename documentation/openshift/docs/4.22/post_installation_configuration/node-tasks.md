After installing OpenShift Container Platform, you can further expand and customize your cluster to your requirements through certain node tasks.

# Adding RHCOS compute machines to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster

You can add more Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) compute machines to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster on bare metal.

Before you add more compute machines to a cluster that you installed on bare metal infrastructure, you must create RHCOS machines for it to use. You can either use an ISO image or network PXE booting to create the machines.

## Prerequisites

- You installed a cluster on bare metal.

- You have installation media and Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) images that you used to create your cluster. If you do not have these files, you must obtain them by following the instructions in the [installation procedure](../installing/installing_bare_metal/upi/installing-bare-metal.xml#installing-bare-metal).

## Creating RHCOS machines using an ISO image

You can create more Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using an ISO image to create the machines.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.

- You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Extract the Ignition config file from the cluster by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data-managed --keys=userData --to=- > worker.ign
    ```

2.  Upload the `worker.ign` Ignition config file you exported from your cluster to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of these files.

3.  You can validate that the ignition files are available on the URLs. The following example gets the Ignition config files for the compute node:

    ``` terminal
    $ curl -k http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign
    ```

4.  You can access the ISO image for booting your new machine by running to following command:

    ``` terminal
    RHCOS_VHD_ORIGIN_URL=$(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' | jq -r '.architectures.<architecture>.artifacts.metal.formats.iso.disk.location')
    ```

5.  Use the ISO file to install RHCOS on more compute machines. Use the same method that you used when you created machines before you installed the cluster:

    - Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.

    - Use ISO redirection with a LOM interface.

6.  Boot the RHCOS ISO image without specifying any options, or interrupting the live boot sequence. Wait for the installer to boot into a shell prompt in the RHCOS live environment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can interrupt the RHCOS installation boot process to add kernel arguments. However, for this ISO procedure you must use the `coreos-installer` command as outlined in the following steps, instead of adding kernel arguments.

7.  Run the `coreos-installer` command and specify the options that meet your installation requirements. At a minimum, you must specify the URL that points to the Ignition config file for the node type, and the device that you are installing to:

    ``` terminal
    $ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://<HTTP_server>/<node_type>.ign <device> --ignition-hash=sha512-<digest>
    ```

    - You must run the `coreos-installer` command by using `sudo`, because the `core` user does not have the required root privileges to perform the installation.

    - The `--ignition-hash` option is required when the Ignition config file is obtained through an HTTP URL to validate the authenticity of the Ignition config file on the cluster node. `<digest>` is the Ignition config file SHA512 digest obtained in a preceding step.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you want to provide your Ignition config files through an HTTPS server that uses TLS, you can add the internal certificate authority (CA) to the system trust store before running `coreos-installer`.

      The following example initializes a compute node installation to the `/dev/sda` device. The Ignition config file for the compute node is obtained from an HTTP web server with the IP address 192.168.1.2:

      ``` terminal
      $ sudo coreos-installer install --ignition-url=http://192.168.1.2:80/installation_directory/worker.ign /dev/sda --ignition-hash=sha512-a5a2d43879223273c9b60af66b44202a1d1248fc01cf156c46d4a79f552b6bad47bc8cc78ddf0116e80c59d2ea9e32ba53bc807afbca581aa059311def2c3e3b
      ```

8.  Monitor the progress of the RHCOS installation on the console of the machine.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Ensure that the installation is successful on each node before commencing with the OpenShift Container Platform installation. Observing the installation process can also help to determine the cause of RHCOS installation issues that might arise.

9.  Continue to create more compute machines for your cluster.

## Creating RHCOS machines by PXE or iPXE booting

You can create more Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using PXE or iPXE booting.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.

- Obtain the URLs of the RHCOS ISO image, compressed metal BIOS, `kernel`, and `initramfs` files that you uploaded to your HTTP server during cluster installation.

- You have access to the PXE booting infrastructure that you used to create the machines for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster during installation. The machines must boot from their local disks after RHCOS is installed on them.

- If you use UEFI, you have access to the `grub.conf` file that you modified during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Confirm that your PXE or iPXE installation for the RHCOS images is correct.

    - For PXE:

          DEFAULT pxeboot
          TIMEOUT 20
          PROMPT 0
          LABEL pxeboot
              KERNEL http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-kernel-<architecture>
              APPEND initrd=http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-initramfs.<architecture>.img coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/sda coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img

      - Specify the location of the live `kernel` file that you uploaded to your HTTP server.

      - Specify locations of the RHCOS files that you uploaded to your HTTP server. The `initrd` parameter value is the location of the live `initramfs` file, the `coreos.inst.ignition_url` parameter value is the location of the worker Ignition config file, and the `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameter value is the location of the live `rootfs` file. The `coreos.inst.ignition_url` and `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameters only support HTTP and HTTPS.

        > [!NOTE]
        > This configuration does not enable serial console access on machines with a graphical console. To configure a different console, add one or more `console=` arguments to the `APPEND` line. For example, add `console=tty0 console=ttyS0` to set the first PC serial port as the primary console and the graphical console as a secondary console. For more information, see [How does one set up a serial terminal and/or console in Red Hat Enterprise Linux?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7212).

    - For iPXE (`x86_64` + `aarch64`):

          kernel http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-kernel-<architecture> initrd=main coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/sda coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign
          initrd --name main http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-initramfs.<architecture>.img
          boot

      - Specify the locations of the RHCOS files that you uploaded to your HTTP server. The `kernel` parameter value is the location of the `kernel` file, the `initrd=main` argument is needed for booting on UEFI systems, the `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameter value is the location of the `rootfs` file, and the `coreos.inst.ignition_url` parameter value is the location of the worker Ignition config file.

      - If you use multiple NICs, specify a single interface in the `ip` option. For example, to use DHCP on a NIC that is named `eno1`, set `ip=eno1:dhcp`.

      - Specify the location of the `initramfs` file that you uploaded to your HTTP server.

        > [!NOTE]
        > This configuration does not enable serial console access on machines with a graphical console To configure a different console, add one or more `console=` arguments to the `kernel` line. For example, add `console=tty0 console=ttyS0` to set the first PC serial port as the primary console and the graphical console as a secondary console. For more information, see [How does one set up a serial terminal and/or console in Red Hat Enterprise Linux?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7212) and "Enabling the serial console for PXE and ISO installation" in the "Advanced RHCOS installation configuration" section.

        > [!NOTE]
        > To network boot the CoreOS `kernel` on `aarch64` architecture, you need to use a version of iPXE build with the `IMAGE_GZIP` option enabled. See [`IMAGE_GZIP` option in iPXE](https://ipxe.org/buildcfg/image_gzip).

    - For PXE (with UEFI and GRUB as second stage) on `aarch64`:

          menuentry 'Install CoreOS' {
              linux rhcos-<version>-live-kernel-<architecture>  coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/sda coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign
              initrd rhcos-<version>-live-initramfs.<architecture>.img
          }

      - Specify the locations of the RHCOS files that you uploaded to your HTTP/TFTP server. The `kernel` parameter value is the location of the `kernel` file on your TFTP server. The `coreos.live.rootfs_url` parameter value is the location of the `rootfs` file, and the `coreos.inst.ignition_url` parameter value is the location of the worker Ignition config file on your HTTP Server.

      - If you use multiple NICs, specify a single interface in the `ip` option. For example, to use DHCP on a NIC that is named `eno1`, set `ip=eno1:dhcp`.

      - Specify the location of the `initramfs` file that you uploaded to your TFTP server.

2.  Use the PXE or iPXE infrastructure to create the required compute machines for your cluster.

</div>

## Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To add machines to a cluster, verify the status of the certificate signing requests (CSRs) generated for each machine. If manual approval is required, approve the client requests first, followed by the server requests.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You added machines to your cluster.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get nodes
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
    master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.34.2
    master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.34.2
    master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.34.2
    ```

    </div>

    The output lists all of the machines that you created.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.

2.  Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the `Pending` or `Approved` status for each machine that you added to the cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
    csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
    csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
    ...
    ```

    </div>

    In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.

3.  If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

    > [!NOTE]
    > Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the `machine-approver` if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the `oc exec`, `oc rsh`, and `oc logs` commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the `node-bootstrapper` service account in the `system:node` or `system:admin` groups, and confirm the identity of the node.

    - To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
      ```

      where:

      `<csr_name>`
      Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

    - To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.

4.  Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
    csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
    csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
    ...
    ```

    </div>

5.  If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the `Pending` status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

    - To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
      ```

      where:

      `<csr_name>`
      Specifies the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

    - To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

      ``` terminal
      $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
      ```

6.  After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the `Ready` status. Verify this by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get nodes
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION

    worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.34.2
    worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.34.2
    ```

    </div>

    > [!NOTE]
    > It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the `Ready` status.

## Adding a new RHCOS worker node with a custom `/var` partition in AWS

OpenShift Container Platform supports partitioning devices during installation by using machine configs that are processed during the bootstrap. However, if you use `/var` partitioning, the device name must be determined at installation and cannot be changed. You cannot add different instance types as nodes if they have a different device naming schema. For example, if you configured the `/var` partition with the default AWS device name for `m4.large` instances, `dev/xvdb`, you cannot directly add an AWS `m5.large` instance, as `m5.large` instances use a `/dev/nvme1n1` device by default. The device might fail to partition due to the different naming schema.

The procedure in this section shows how to add a new Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) compute node with an instance that uses a different device name from what was configured at installation. You create a custom user data secret and configure a new compute machine set. These steps are specific to an AWS cluster. The principles apply to other cloud deployments also. However, the device naming schema is different for other deployments and should be determined on a per-case basis.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  On a command line, change to the `openshift-machine-api` namespace:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc project openshift-machine-api
    ```

2.  Create a new secret from the `worker-user-data` secret:

    1.  Export the `userData` section of the secret to a text file:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get secret worker-user-data --template='{{index .data.userData | base64decode}}' | jq > userData.txt
        ```

    2.  Edit the text file to add the `storage`, `filesystems`, and `systemd` stanzas for the partitions you want to use for the new node. You can specify any [Ignition configuration parameters](https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_2/) as needed.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Do not change the values in the `ignition` stanza.

        ``` terminal

                ]
              }
            ],

              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        - Specifies an absolute path to the AWS block device.

        - Specifies the size of the data partition in Mebibytes.

        - Specifies the start of the partition in Mebibytes. When adding a data partition to the boot disk, a minimum value of 25000 MB (Mebibytes) is recommended. The root file system is automatically resized to fill all available space up to the specified offset. If no value is specified, or if the specified value is smaller than the recommended minimum, the resulting root file system will be too small, and future reinstalls of RHCOS might overwrite the beginning of the data partition.

        - Specifies an absolute path to the `/var` partition.

        - Specifies the filesystem format.

        - Specifies the mount-point of the filesystem while Ignition is running relative to where the root filesystem will be mounted. This is not necessarily the same as where it should be mounted in the real root, but it is encouraged to make it the same.

        - Defines a systemd mount unit that mounts the `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/var` device to the `/var` partition.

    3.  Extract the `disableTemplating` section from the `work-user-data` secret to a text file:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc get secret worker-user-data --template='{{index .data.disableTemplating | base64decode}}' | jq > disableTemplating.txt
        ```

    4.  Create the new user data secret file from the two text files. This user data secret passes the additional node partition information in the `userData.txt` file to the newly created node.

        ``` terminal
        $ oc create secret generic worker-user-data-x5 --from-file=userData=userData.txt --from-file=disableTemplating=disableTemplating.txt
        ```

3.  Create a new compute machine set for the new node:

    1.  Create a new compute machine set YAML file, similar to the following, which is configured for AWS. Add the required partitions and the newly-created user data secret:

        > [!TIP]
        > Use an existing compute machine set as a template and change the parameters as needed for the new node.

        ``` terminal

# Deploying machine health checks

Understand and deploy machine health checks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use the advanced machine management and scaling capabilities only in clusters where the Machine API is operational. Clusters with user-provisioned infrastructure require additional validation and configuration to use the Machine API.
>
> Clusters with the infrastructure platform type `none` cannot use the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that supports the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation.
>
> To view the platform type for your cluster, run the following command:
>
> ``` terminal
> $ oc get infrastructure cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.platform}'
> ```

## About machine health checks

> [!NOTE]
> You can only apply a machine health check to machines that are managed by compute machine sets or control plane machine sets.

To monitor machine health, create a resource to define the configuration for a controller. Set a condition to check, such as staying in the `NotReady` status for five minutes or displaying a permanent condition in the node-problem-detector, and a label for the set of machines to monitor.

The controller that observes a `MachineHealthCheck` resource checks for the defined condition. If a machine fails the health check, the machine is automatically deleted and one is created to take its place. When a machine is deleted, you see a `machine deleted` event.

To limit disruptive impact of the machine deletion, the controller drains and deletes only one node at a time. If there are more unhealthy machines than the `maxUnhealthy` threshold allows for in the targeted pool of machines, remediation stops and therefore enables manual intervention.

> [!NOTE]
> Consider the timeouts carefully, accounting for workloads and requirements.
>
> - Long timeouts can result in long periods of downtime for the workload on the unhealthy machine.
>
> - Too short timeouts can result in a remediation loop. For example, the timeout for checking the `NotReady` status must be long enough to allow the machine to complete the startup process.

To stop the check, remove the resource.

### Limitations when deploying machine health checks

There are limitations to consider before deploying a machine health check:

- Only machines owned by a machine set are remediated by a machine health check.

- If the node for a machine is removed from the cluster, a machine health check considers the machine to be unhealthy and remediates it immediately.

- If the corresponding node for a machine does not join the cluster after the `nodeStartupTimeout`, the machine is remediated.

- A machine is remediated immediately if the `Machine` resource phase is `Failed`.

</div>

## Sample MachineHealthCheck resource

The `MachineHealthCheck` resource for all cloud-based installation types, and other than bare metal, resembles the following YAML file:

``` yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineHealthCheck
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role: <role>
      machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-type: <role>
      machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset: <cluster_name>-<label>-<zone>
  unhealthyConditions:
  - type:    "Ready"
    timeout: "300s"
    status: "False"
  - type:    "Ready"
    timeout: "300s"
    status: "Unknown"
  maxUnhealthy: "40%"
  nodeStartupTimeout: "10m"
```

- Specify the name of the machine health check to deploy.

- Specify a label for the machine pool that you want to check.

- Specify the machine set to track in `<cluster_name>-<label>-<zone>` format. For example, `prod-node-us-east-1a`.

- Specify the timeout duration for a node condition. If a condition is met for the duration of the timeout, the machine will be remediated. Long timeouts can result in long periods of downtime for a workload on an unhealthy machine.

- Specify the amount of machines allowed to be concurrently remediated in the targeted pool. This can be set as a percentage or an integer. If the number of unhealthy machines exceeds the limit set by `maxUnhealthy`, remediation is not performed.

- Specify the timeout duration that a machine health check must wait for a node to join the cluster before a machine is determined to be unhealthy.

> [!NOTE]
> The `matchLabels` are examples only; you must map your machine groups based on your specific needs.

### Short-circuiting machine health check remediation

Short-circuiting ensures that machine health checks remediate machines only when the cluster is healthy. Short-circuiting is configured through the `maxUnhealthy` field in the `MachineHealthCheck` resource.

If the user defines a value for the `maxUnhealthy` field, before remediating any machines, the `MachineHealthCheck` compares the value of `maxUnhealthy` with the number of machines within its target pool that it has determined to be unhealthy. Remediation is not performed if the number of unhealthy machines exceeds the `maxUnhealthy` limit.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `maxUnhealthy` is not set, the value defaults to `100%` and the machines are remediated regardless of the state of the cluster.

The appropriate `maxUnhealthy` value depends on the scale of the cluster you deploy and how many machines the `MachineHealthCheck` covers. For example, you can use the `maxUnhealthy` value to cover multiple compute machine sets across multiple availability zones so that if you lose an entire zone, your `maxUnhealthy` setting prevents further remediation within the cluster. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you configure a `MachineHealthCheck` resource for the control plane, set the value of `maxUnhealthy` to `1`.
>
> This configuration ensures that the machine health check takes no action when multiple control plane machines appear to be unhealthy. Multiple unhealthy control plane machines can indicate that the etcd cluster is degraded or that a scaling operation to replace a failed machine is in progress.
>
> If the etcd cluster is degraded, manual intervention might be required. If a scaling operation is in progress, the machine health check should allow it to finish.

The `maxUnhealthy` field can be set as either an integer or percentage. There are different remediation implementations depending on the `maxUnhealthy` value.

#### Setting maxUnhealthy by using an absolute value

If `maxUnhealthy` is set to `2`:

- Remediation will be performed if 2 or fewer nodes are unhealthy

- Remediation will not be performed if 3 or more nodes are unhealthy

These values are independent of how many machines are being checked by the machine health check.

#### Setting maxUnhealthy by using percentages

If `maxUnhealthy` is set to `40%` and there are 25 machines being checked:

- Remediation will be performed if 10 or fewer nodes are unhealthy

- Remediation will not be performed if 11 or more nodes are unhealthy

If `maxUnhealthy` is set to `40%` and there are 6 machines being checked:

- Remediation will be performed if 2 or fewer nodes are unhealthy

- Remediation will not be performed if 3 or more nodes are unhealthy

> [!NOTE]
> The allowed number of machines is rounded down when the percentage of `maxUnhealthy` machines that are checked is not a whole number.

## Creating a machine health check resource

You can create a `MachineHealthCheck` resource for machine sets in your cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only apply a machine health check to machines that are managed by compute machine sets or control plane machine sets.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Install the `oc` command-line interface.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create a `healthcheck.yml` file that contains the definition of your machine health check.

2.  Apply the `healthcheck.yml` file to your cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc apply -f healthcheck.yml
    ```

</div>

## Scaling a compute machine set manually

To add or remove an instance of a machine in a compute machine set, you can manually scale the compute machine set.

This guidance is relevant to fully automated, installer-provisioned infrastructure installations. Customized, user-provisioned infrastructure installations do not have compute machine sets.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the `oc` command line.

- Log in to `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  View the compute machine sets that are in the cluster by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get machinesets.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
    ```

    The compute machine sets are listed in the form of `<clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>`.

2.  View the compute machines that are in the cluster by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get machines.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
    ```

3.  Set the annotation on the compute machine that you want to delete by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc annotate machines.machine.openshift.io/<machine_name> -n openshift-machine-api machine.openshift.io/delete-machine="true"
    ```

4.  Scale the compute machine set by running one of the following commands:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc scale --replicas=2 machinesets.machine.openshift.io <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
    ```

    Or:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit machinesets.machine.openshift.io <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > You can alternatively apply the following YAML to scale the compute machine set:
    >
    > ``` yaml
    > apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
    > kind: MachineSet
    > metadata:
    >   name: <machineset>
    >   namespace: openshift-machine-api
    > spec:
    >   replicas: 2
    > ```

    You can scale the compute machine set up or down. It takes several minutes for the new machines to be available.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > By default, the machine controller tries to drain the node that is backed by the machine until it succeeds. In some situations, such as with a misconfigured pod disruption budget, the drain operation might not be able to succeed. If the drain operation fails, the machine controller cannot proceed removing the machine.
    >
    > You can skip draining the node by annotating `machine.openshift.io/exclude-node-draining` in a specific machine.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

- Verify the deletion of the intended machine by running the following command:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get machines.machine.openshift.io
  ```

</div>

## Understanding the difference between compute machine sets and the machine config pool

`MachineSet` objects describe OpenShift Container Platform nodes with respect to the cloud or machine provider.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows `MachineConfigController` components to define and provide the status of machines in the context of upgrades.

The `MachineConfigPool` object allows users to configure how upgrades are rolled out to the OpenShift Container Platform nodes in the machine config pool.

The `NodeSelector` object can be replaced with a reference to the `MachineSet` object.

# Recommended node host practices

The OpenShift Container Platform node configuration file contains important options. For example, two parameters control the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled to a node: `podsPerCore` and `maxPods`.

When both options are in use, the lower of the two values limits the number of pods on a node. Exceeding these values can result in the following conditions:

- Increased CPU utilization.

- Slow pod scheduling.

- Potential out-of-memory scenarios, depending on the amount of memory in the node.

- Exhausting the pool of IP addresses.

- Resource overcommitting, leading to poor user application performance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Kubernetes, a pod that is holding a single container actually uses two containers. The second container is used to set up networking prior to the actual container starting. Therefore, a system running 10 pods will actually have 20 containers running.

> [!NOTE]
> Disk IOPS throttling from the cloud provider might have an impact on CRI-O and kubelet. They might get overloaded when there are large number of I/O intensive pods running on the nodes. It is recommended that you monitor the disk I/O on the nodes and use volumes with sufficient throughput for the workload.

The `podsPerCore` parameter sets the number of pods that the node can run based on the number of processor cores on the node. For example, if `podsPerCore` is set to `10` on a node with 4 processor cores, the maximum number of pods allowed on the node is `40`.

``` yaml
kubeletConfig:
  podsPerCore: 10
```

Setting `podsPerCore` to `0` disables this limit. The default is `0`. The value of the `podsPerCore` parameter cannot exceed the value of the `maxPods` parameter.

The `maxPods` parameter sets the number of pods that the node can run to a fixed value, regardless of the properties of the node.

``` yaml
 kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: 250
```

## Creating a KubeletConfig CR to edit kubelet parameters

The kubelet configuration is currently serialized as an Ignition configuration, so it can be directly edited. However, there is also a new `kubelet-config-controller` added to the Machine Config Controller (MCC). This lets you use a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) to edit the kubelet parameters.

> [!NOTE]
> As the fields in the `kubeletConfig` object are passed directly to the kubelet from upstream Kubernetes, the kubelet validates those values directly. Invalid values in the `kubeletConfig` object might cause cluster nodes to become unavailable. For valid values, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/).

Consider the following guidance:

- Edit an existing `KubeletConfig` CR to modify existing settings or add new settings, instead of creating a CR for each change. It is recommended that you create a CR only to modify a different machine config pool, or for changes that are intended to be temporary, so that you can revert the changes.

- Create one `KubeletConfig` CR for each machine config pool with all the config changes you want for that pool.

- As needed, create multiple `KubeletConfig` CRs with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first `KubeletConfig` CR, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) creates a machine config appended with `kubelet`. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates another `kubelet` machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a `kubelet` machine config with a `-2` suffix, the next `kubelet` machine config is appended with `-3`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are applying a kubelet or container runtime config to a custom machine config pool, the custom role in the `machineConfigSelector` must match the name of the custom machine config pool.
>
> For example, because the following custom machine config pool is named `infra`, the custom role must also be `infra`:
>
> ``` yaml
> apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
> kind: MachineConfigPool
> metadata:
>   name: infra
> spec:
>   machineConfigSelector:
>     matchExpressions:
>       - {key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker,infra]}
> # ...
> ```

If you want to delete the machine configs, delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, you delete the `kubelet-3` machine config before deleting the `kubelet-2` machine config.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a machine config with a `kubelet-9` suffix, and you create another `KubeletConfig` CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 `kubelet` machine configs.

    ``` terminal
    $ oc describe node ci-ln-5grqprb-f76d1-ncnqq-worker-a-mdv94
    ```

    Look for `value: pods: <value>` in the `Allocatable` stanza:

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    Allocatable:
     attachable-volumes-aws-ebs:  25
     cpu:                         3500m
     hugepages-1Gi:               0
     hugepages-2Mi:               0
     memory:                      15341844Ki
     pods:                        250
    ```

    </div>

3.  Configure the worker nodes as needed:

    1.  Create a YAML file similar to the following that contains the kubelet configuration:

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Kubelet configurations that target a specific machine config pool also affect any dependent pools. For example, creating a kubelet configuration for the pool containing worker nodes will also apply to any subset pools, including the pool containing infrastructure nodes. To avoid this, you must create a new machine config pool with a selection expression that only includes worker nodes, and have your kubelet configuration target this new pool.

        ``` yaml
        apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
        kind: KubeletConfig
        metadata:
          name: set-kubelet-config
        spec:
          machineConfigPoolSelector:
            matchLabels:
              custom-kubelet: set-kubelet-config
          kubeletConfig:
              podPidsLimit: 8192
              containerLogMaxSize: 50Mi
              maxPods: 500
        ```

        - Enter the label from the machine config pool.

        - Add the kubelet configuration. For example:

          - Use `podPidsLimit` to set the maximum number of PIDs in any pod.

          - Use `containerLogMaxSize` to set the maximum size of the container log file before it is rotated.

          - Use `maxPods` to set the maximum pods per node.

            > [!NOTE]
            > The rate at which the kubelet talks to the API server depends on queries per second (QPS) and burst values. The default values, `50` for `kubeAPIQPS` and `100` for `kubeAPIBurst`, are sufficient if there are limited pods running on each node. It is recommended to update the kubelet QPS and burst rates if there are enough CPU and memory resources on the node.
            >
            > ``` yaml
            > apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
            > kind: KubeletConfig
            > metadata:
            >   name: set-kubelet-config
            > spec:
            >   machineConfigPoolSelector:
            >     matchLabels:
            >       custom-kubelet: set-kubelet-config
            >   kubeletConfig:
            >     maxPods: <pod_count>
            >     kubeAPIBurst: <burst_rate>
            >     kubeAPIQPS: <QPS>
            > ```

    2.  Update the machine config pool for workers with the label:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-kubelet-config
        ```

    3.  Create the `KubeletConfig` object:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc create -f change-maxPods-cr.yaml
        ```

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

1.  Verify that the `KubeletConfig` object is created:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get kubeletconfig
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME                      AGE
    set-kubelet-config        15m
    ```

    </div>

    Depending on the number of worker nodes in the cluster, wait for the worker nodes to be rebooted one by one. For a cluster with 3 worker nodes, this could take about 10 to 15 minutes.

2.  Verify that the changes are applied to the node:

    1.  Check on a worker node that the `maxPods` value changed:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc describe node <node_name>
        ```

    2.  Locate the `Allocatable` stanza:

        ``` terminal
         ...
        Allocatable:
          attachable-volumes-gce-pd:  127
          cpu:                        3500m
          ephemeral-storage:          123201474766
          hugepages-1Gi:              0
          hugepages-2Mi:              0
          memory:                     14225400Ki
          pods:                       500
         ...
        ```

        - In this example, the `pods` parameter should report the value you set in the `KubeletConfig` object.

3.  Verify the change in the `KubeletConfig` object:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get kubeletconfigs set-kubelet-config -o yaml
    ```

    This should show a status of `True` and `type:Success`, as shown in the following example:

    ``` yaml
    spec:
      kubeletConfig:
        containerLogMaxSize: 50Mi
        maxPods: 500
        podPidsLimit: 8192
      machineConfigPoolSelector:
        matchLabels:
          custom-kubelet: set-kubelet-config
    status:
      conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2021-06-30T17:04:07Z"
        message: Success
        status: "True"
        type: Success
    ```

</div>

## Modifying the number of unavailable worker nodes

By default, only one machine is allowed to be unavailable when applying the kubelet-related configuration to the available worker nodes. For a large cluster, it can take a long time for the configuration change to be reflected. At any time, you can adjust the number of machines that are updating to speed up the process.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Edit the `worker` machine config pool:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
    ```

2.  Add the `maxUnavailable` field and set the value:

    ``` yaml
    spec:
      maxUnavailable: <node_count>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When setting the value, consider the number of worker nodes that can be unavailable without affecting the applications running on the cluster.

## Control plane node sizing

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

The control plane node resource requirements depend on the number and type of nodes and objects in the cluster. Reference the control plane node size recommendations to better understand your sizing needs.

</div>

The following control plane node size recommendations are based on the results of a control plane density focused testing, or *Cluster-density*. This test creates the following objects across a given number of namespaces:

- 1 image stream

- 1 build

- 5 deployments, with 2 pod replicas in a `sleep` state, mounting 4 secrets, 4 config maps, and 1 downward API volume each

- 5 services, each one pointing to the TCP/8080 and TCP/8443 ports of one of the previous deployments

- 1 route pointing to the first of the previous services

- 10 secrets containing 2048 random string characters

- 10 config maps containing 2048 random string characters

| Number of compute nodes | Cluster-density (namespaces) | CPU cores | Memory (GB) |
|----|----|----|----|
| 24 | 500 | 4 | 16 |
| 120 | 1000 | 8 | 32 |
| 252 | 4000 | 16, but 24 if using the OVN-Kubernetes network plug-in | 64, but 128 if using the OVN-Kubernetes network plug-in |
| 501, but untested with the OVN-Kubernetes network plug-in | 4000 | 16 | 96 |

The data from the table above is based on an OpenShift Container Platform running on top of AWS, using r5.4xlarge instances as control-plane nodes and m5.2xlarge instances as compute nodes.

On a large and dense cluster with three control plane nodes, the CPU and memory usage will spike up when one of the nodes is stopped, rebooted, or fails. The failures can be due to unexpected issues with power, network, underlying infrastructure, or intentional cases where the cluster is restarted after shutting it down to save costs. The remaining two control plane nodes must handle the load in order to be highly available, which leads to increase in the resource usage. This is also expected during upgrades because the control plane nodes are cordoned, drained, and rebooted serially to apply the operating system updates, as well as the control plane Operators update. To avoid cascading failures, keep the overall CPU and memory resource usage on the control plane nodes to at most 60% of all available capacity to handle the resource usage spikes. Increase the CPU and memory on the control plane nodes accordingly to avoid potential downtime due to lack of resources.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The node sizing varies depending on the number of nodes and object counts in the cluster. It also depends on whether the objects are actively being created on the cluster. During object creation, the control plane is more active in terms of resource usage compared to when the objects are in the `Running` phase.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) runs on the control plane nodes and its memory footprint depends on the number of namespaces and user installed operators that OLM needs to manage on the cluster. Control plane nodes need to be sized accordingly to avoid OOM kills. Following data points are based on the results from cluster maximums testing.

| Number of namespaces | OLM memory at idle state (GB) | OLM memory with 5 user operators installed (GB) |
|----|----|----|
| 500 | 0.823 | 1.7 |
| 1000 | 1.2 | 2.5 |
| 1500 | 1.7 | 3.2 |
| 2000 | 2 | 4.4 |
| 3000 | 2.7 | 5.6 |
| 4000 | 3.8 | 7.6 |
| 5000 | 4.2 | 9.02 |
| 6000 | 5.8 | 11.3 |
| 7000 | 6.6 | 12.9 |
| 8000 | 6.9 | 14.8 |
| 9000 | 8 | 17.7 |
| 10,000 | 9.9 | 21.6 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can modify the control plane node size in a running OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 cluster for the following configurations only:
>
> - Clusters installed with a user-provisioned installation method.
>
> - AWS clusters installed with an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation method.
>
> - Clusters that use a control plane machine set to manage control plane machines.
>
> For all other configurations, you must estimate your total node count and use the suggested control plane node size during installation.

> [!NOTE]
> In OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, half of a CPU core (500 millicore) is now reserved by the system by default compared to OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 and previous versions. The sizes are determined taking that into consideration.

## Setting up CPU Manager

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To configure CPU manager, create a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) and apply it to the required set of nodes.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Label a node by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    # oc label node perf-node.example.com cpumanager=true
    ```

2.  To enable CPU Manager for all compute nodes, edit the CR by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    # oc edit machineconfigpool worker
    ```

3.  Add the `custom-kubelet: cpumanager-enabled` label to `metadata.labels` section.

    ``` yaml
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: 2020-xx-xxx
      generation: 3
      labels:
        custom-kubelet: cpumanager-enabled
    ```

4.  Create a `KubeletConfig`, `cpumanager-kubeletconfig.yaml`, custom resource (CR). Refer to the label created in the previous step to have the correct nodes updated with the new kubelet config. See the `machineConfigPoolSelector` section:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: KubeletConfig
    metadata:
      name: cpumanager-enabled
    spec:
      machineConfigPoolSelector:
        matchLabels:
          custom-kubelet: cpumanager-enabled
      kubeletConfig:
         cpuManagerPolicy: static
         cpuManagerReconcilePeriod: 5s
    ```

    - `cpuManagerPolicy` specifies a policy:

      - `none`. This policy explicitly enables the existing default CPU affinity scheme, providing no affinity beyond what the scheduler does automatically. This is the default policy.

      - `static`. This policy allows containers in guaranteed pods with integer CPU requests. It also limits access to exclusive CPUs on the node. If `static`, you must use a lowercase `s`.

    - `cpuManagerReconcilePeriod` is optional. Specify the CPU Manager reconcile frequency. The default is `5s`.

5.  Create the dynamic kubelet config by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    # oc create -f cpumanager-kubeletconfig.yaml
    ```

    This adds the CPU Manager feature to the kubelet config and, if needed, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots the node. To enable CPU Manager, a reboot is not needed.

6.  Check for the merged kubelet config by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    # oc get machineconfig 99-worker-XXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXXX-kubelet -o json | grep ownerReference -A7
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` json
           "ownerReferences": [
                {
                    "apiVersion": "machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1",
                    "kind": "KubeletConfig",
                    "name": "cpumanager-enabled",
                    "uid": "7ed5616d-6b72-11e9-aae1-021e1ce18878"
                }
            ]
    ```

    </div>

7.  Check the compute node for the updated `kubelet.conf` file by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    # oc debug node/perf-node.example.com
    sh-4.2# cat /host/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf | grep cpuManager
    ```

    The following is example output:

    ``` terminal
    cpuManagerPolicy: static
    cpuManagerReconcilePeriod: 5s
    ```

    - `cpuManagerPolicy` is defined when you create the `KubeletConfig` CR.

    - `cpuManagerReconcilePeriod` is defined when you create the `KubeletConfig` CR.

8.  Create a project by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc new-project <project_name>
    ```

9.  Create a pod that requests a core or multiple cores. Both limits and requests must have their CPU value set to a whole integer. That is the number of cores that will be dedicated to this pod:

    ``` terminal
    # cat cpumanager-pod.yaml
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` yaml

2.  Verify that a CPU has been exclusively assigned to the pod by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    # oc describe node --selector='cpumanager=true' | grep -i cpumanager- -B2
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    </div>

3.  Verify that the `cgroups` are set up correctly. Get the process ID (PID) of the `pause` process by running the following commands:

    ``` terminal
    # oc debug node/perf-node.example.com
    ```

    ``` terminal
    sh-4.2# systemctl status | grep -B5 pause
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the output returns multiple pause process entries, you must identify the correct pause process.

    </div>

4.  Verify that pods of quality of service (QoS) tier `Guaranteed` are placed within the `kubepods.slice` subdirectory by running the following commands:

    ``` terminal
    # cd /sys/fs/cgroup/kubepods.slice/kubepods-pod69c01f8e_6b74_11e9_ac0f_0a2b62178a22.slice/crio-b5437308f1ad1a7db0574c542bdf08563b865c0345c86e9585f8c0b0a655612c.scope

5.  Check the allowed CPU list for the task by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    # grep ^Cpus_allowed_list /proc/32706/status
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    ``` terminal
     Cpus_allowed_list:    1

6.  Verify that another pod on the system cannot run on the core allocated for the `Guaranteed` pod. For example, to verify the pod in the `besteffort` QoS tier, run the following commands:

    ``` terminal
    # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/kubepods.slice/kubepods-besteffort.slice/kubepods-besteffort-podc494a073_6b77_11e9_98c0_06bba5c387ea.slice/crio-c56982f57b75a2420947f0afc6cafe7534c5734efc34157525fa9abbf99e3849.scope/cpuset.cpus

    ```

    </div>

    This VM has two CPU cores. The `system-reserved` setting reserves 500 millicores, meaning that half of one core is subtracted from the total capacity of the node to arrive at the `Node Allocatable` amount. You can see that `Allocatable CPU` is 1500 millicores. This means you can run one of the CPU Manager pods since each will take one whole core. A whole core is equivalent to 1000 millicores. If you try to schedule a second pod, the system will accept the pod, but it will never be scheduled:

    ``` terminal
    NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    cpumanager-6cqz7        1/1     Running   0          33m
    cpumanager-7qc2t        0/1     Pending   0          11s
    ```

# Huge pages

Understand and configure huge pages.

## What huge pages do

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To optimize memory mapping efficiency, understand the function of huge pages. Unlike standard 4Ki blocks, huge pages are larger memory segments that reduce the tracking load on the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) hardware cache.

</div>

Memory is managed in blocks known as pages. On most systems, a page is 4Ki; 1Mi of memory is equal to 256 pages; 1Gi of memory is 256,000 pages, and so on. CPUs have a built-in memory management unit that manages a list of these pages in hardware. The translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a small hardware cache of virtual-to-physical page mappings. If the virtual address passed in a hardware instruction can be found in the TLB, the mapping can be determined quickly. If not, a TLB miss occurs, and the system falls back to slower, software-based address translation, resulting in performance issues. Since the size of the TLB is fixed, the only way to reduce the chance of a TLB miss is to increase the page size.

A huge page is a memory page that is larger than 4Ki. On x86_64 architectures, there are two common huge page sizes: 2Mi and 1Gi. Sizes vary on other architectures. To use huge pages, code must be written so that applications are aware of them. Transparent huge pages (THP) attempt to automate the management of huge pages without application knowledge, but they have limitations. In particular, they are limited to 2Mi page sizes. THP can lead to performance degradation on nodes with high memory utilization or fragmentation because of defragmenting efforts of THP, which can lock memory pages. For this reason, some applications might be designed to or recommend usage of pre-allocated huge pages instead of THP.

## How huge pages are consumed by apps

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You must ensure that nodes pre-allocate huge pages in order for the node to report its huge page capacity. A node can only pre-allocate huge pages for a single size.

</div>

Huge pages can be consumed through container-level resource requirements by using the resource name `hugepages-<size>`, where size is the most compact binary notation by using integer values supported on a particular node. For example, if a node supports 2048 KiB page sizes, the node exposes a schedulable resource `hugepages-2Mi`. Unlike CPU or memory, huge pages do not support over-commitment.

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: hugepages-volume-
spec:
  containers:
  - securityContext:
      privileged: true
    image: rhel7:latest
    command:
    - sleep
    - inf
    name: example
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /dev/hugepages
      name: hugepage
    resources:
      limits:
        hugepages-2Mi: 100Mi
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "1"
  volumes:
  - name: hugepage
    emptyDir:
      medium: HugePages
```

- `spec.containers.resources.limits.hugepages-2Mi`: Specifies the amount of memory for `hugepages` as the exact amount to be allocated.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Do not specify this value as the amount of memory for `hugepages` multiplied by the size of the page. For example, given a huge page size of 2 MB, if you want to use 100 MB of huge-page-backed RAM for your application, then you would allocate 50 huge pages. OpenShift Container Platform handles the math for you. As in the above example, you can specify `100MB` directly.

### Allocating huge pages of a specific size

Some platforms support multiple huge page sizes. To allocate huge pages of a specific size, precede the huge pages boot command parameters with a huge page size selection parameter `hugepagesz=<size>`. The `<size>` value must be specified in bytes with an optional scale suffix \[`kKmMgG`\]. The default huge page size can be defined with the `default_hugepagesz=<size>` boot parameter.

### Huge page requirements

- Huge page requests must equal the limits. This is the default if limits are specified, but requests are not.

- Huge pages are isolated at a pod scope. Container isolation is planned in a future iteration.

- `EmptyDir` volumes backed by huge pages must not consume more huge page memory than the pod request.

- Applications that consume huge pages via `shmget()` with `SHM_HUGETLB` must run with a supplemental group that matches ***proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group***.

## Configuring huge pages at boot time

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To ensure nodes in your OpenShift Container Platform cluster pre-allocate memory for specific workloads, reserve huge pages at boot time.

</div>

There are two ways of reserving huge pages: at boot time and at run time. Reserving at boot time increases the possibility of success because the memory has not yet been significantly fragmented. The Node Tuning Operator currently supports boot-time allocation of huge pages on specific nodes.

> [!NOTE]
> The TuneD boot-loader plugin only supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) compute nodes.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Label all nodes that need the same huge pages setting by a label by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc label node <node_using_hugepages> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-hp=
    ```

2.  Create a file with the following content and name it `hugepages-tuned-boottime.yaml`:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Tuned
    metadata:
      name: hugepages
      namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
    spec:
      profile:
      - data: |
          [main]
          summary=Boot time configuration for hugepages
          include=openshift-node
          [bootloader]
          cmdline_openshift_node_hugepages=hugepagesz=2M hugepages=50
        name: openshift-node-hugepages

      recommend:
      - machineConfigLabels:
          machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker-hp"
        priority: 30
        profile: openshift-node-hugepages
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `metadata.name`
    Specifies the `name` of the Tuned resource to `hugepages`.

    `spec.profile`
    Specifies the `profile` section to allocate huge pages.

    `spec.profile.data`
    Specifies the order of parameters. The order is important as some platforms support huge pages of various sizes.

    `spec.recommend.machineConfigLabels`
    Specifies the enablement of a machine config pool based matching.

3.  Create the Tuned `hugepages` object by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f hugepages-tuned-boottime.yaml
    ```

4.  Create a file with the following content and name it `hugepages-mcp.yaml`:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfigPool
    metadata:
      name: worker-hp
      labels:
        worker-hp: ""
    spec:
      machineConfigSelector:
        matchExpressions:
          - {key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker,worker-hp]}
      nodeSelector:
        matchLabels:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-hp: ""
    ```

5.  Create the machine config pool by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f hugepages-mcp.yaml
    ```

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

- To check that enough non-fragmented memory exists and that all the nodes in the `worker-hp` machine config pool now have 50 2Mi huge pages allocated, enter the following command:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get node <node_using_hugepages> -o jsonpath="{.status.allocatable.hugepages-2Mi}"
  100Mi
  ```

</div>

# Understanding device plugins

The device plugin provides a consistent and portable solution to consume hardware devices across clusters. The device plugin provides support for these devices through an extension mechanism, which makes these devices available to Containers, provides health checks of these devices, and securely shares them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OpenShift Container Platform supports the device plugin API, but the device plugin Containers are supported by individual vendors.

A device plugin is a gRPC service running on the nodes (external to the `kubelet`) that is responsible for managing specific hardware resources. Any device plugin must support following remote procedure calls (RPCs):

``` golang
service DevicePlugin {
      // GetDevicePluginOptions returns options to be communicated with Device
      // Manager
      rpc GetDevicePluginOptions(Empty) returns (DevicePluginOptions) {}

      // ListAndWatch returns a stream of List of Devices
      // Whenever a Device state change or a Device disappears, ListAndWatch
      // returns the new list
      rpc ListAndWatch(Empty) returns (stream ListAndWatchResponse) {}

      // Allocate is called during container creation so that the Device
      // Plug-in can run device specific operations and instruct Kubelet
      // of the steps to make the Device available in the container
      rpc Allocate(AllocateRequest) returns (AllocateResponse) {}

      // PreStartcontainer is called, if indicated by Device Plug-in during
      // registration phase, before each container start. Device plug-in
      // can run device specific operations such as resetting the device
      // before making devices available to the container
      rpc PreStartcontainer(PreStartcontainerRequest) returns (PreStartcontainerResponse) {}
}
```

## Example device plugins

- [Nvidia GPU device plugin for COS-based operating system](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/Container-engine-accelerators/tree/master/cmd/nvidia_gpu)

- [Nvidia official GPU device plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin)

- [Solarflare device plugin](https://github.com/vikaschoudhary16/sfc-device-plugin)

- [KubeVirt device plugins: vfio and kvm](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubernetes-device-plugins)

- [Kubernetes device plugin for IBM® Crypto Express (CEX) cards](https://github.com/ibm-s390-cloud/k8s-cex-dev-plugin)

> [!NOTE]
> For easy device plugin reference implementation, there is a stub device plugin in the Device Manager code: ***vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/cm/deviceplugin/device_plugin_stub.go***.

## Methods for deploying a device plugin

- Daemon sets are the recommended approach for device plugin deployments.

- Upon start, the device plugin will try to create a UNIX domain socket at ***/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugin/*** on the node to serve RPCs from Device Manager.

- Since device plugins must manage hardware resources, access to the host file system, as well as socket creation, they must be run in a privileged security context.

- More specific details regarding deployment steps can be found with each device plugin implementation.

## Understanding the Device Manager

Device Manager provides a mechanism for advertising specialized node hardware resources with the help of plugins known as device plugins.

You can advertise specialized hardware without requiring any upstream code changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OpenShift Container Platform supports the device plugin API, but the device plugin Containers are supported by individual vendors.

Device Manager advertises devices as **Extended Resources**. User pods can consume devices, advertised by Device Manager, using the same **Limit/Request** mechanism, which is used for requesting any other **Extended Resource**.

Upon start, the device plugin registers itself with Device Manager invoking `Register` on the ***/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock*** and starts a gRPC service at ***/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/\<plugin\>.sock*** for serving Device Manager requests.

Device Manager, while processing a new registration request, invokes `ListAndWatch` remote procedure call (RPC) at the device plugin service. In response, Device Manager gets a list of **Device** objects from the plugin over a gRPC stream. Device Manager will keep watching on the stream for new updates from the plugin. On the plugin side, the plugin will also keep the stream open and whenever there is a change in the state of any of the devices, a new device list is sent to the Device Manager over the same streaming connection.

While handling a new pod admission request, Kubelet passes requested `Extended Resources` to the Device Manager for device allocation. Device Manager checks in its database to verify if a corresponding plugin exists or not. If the plugin exists and there are free allocatable devices as well as per local cache, `Allocate` RPC is invoked at that particular device plugin.

Additionally, device plugins can also perform several other device-specific operations, such as driver installation, device initialization, and device resets. These functionalities vary from implementation to implementation.

## Enabling Device Manager

Enable Device Manager to implement a device plugin to advertise specialized hardware without any upstream code changes.

Device Manager provides a mechanism for advertising specialized node hardware resources with the help of plugins known as device plugins.

1.  Obtain the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CRD for the type of node you want to configure by entering the following command. Perform one of the following steps:

    1.  View the machine config:

        ``` terminal
        # oc describe machineconfig <name>
        ```

        For example:

        ``` terminal
        # oc describe machineconfig 00-worker
        ```

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

        Example output

        </div>

        ``` terminal
        Name:         00-worker
        Namespace:
        Labels:       machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role=worker
        ```

        </div>

        - Label required for the Device Manager.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create a custom resource (CR) for your configuration change.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Sample configuration for a Device Manager CR

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: KubeletConfig
    metadata:
      name: devicemgr
    spec:
      machineConfigPoolSelector:
        matchLabels:
           machineconfiguration.openshift.io: devicemgr
      kubeletConfig:
        feature-gates:
          - DevicePlugins=true
    ```

    </div>

    - Assign a name to CR.

    - Enter the label from the Machine Config Pool.

    - Set `DevicePlugins` to 'true\`.

2.  Create the Device Manager:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f devicemgr.yaml
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    kubeletconfig.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/devicemgr created
    ```

    </div>

3.  Ensure that Device Manager was actually enabled by confirming that ***/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock*** is created on the node. This is the UNIX domain socket on which the Device Manager gRPC server listens for new plugin registrations. This sock file is created when the Kubelet is started only if Device Manager is enabled.

# Taints and tolerations

Understand and work with taints and tolerations.

## Understanding taints and tolerations

A *taint* allows a node to refuse a pod to be scheduled unless that pod has a matching *toleration*.

You apply taints to a node through the `Node` specification (`NodeSpec`) and apply tolerations to a pod through the `Pod` specification (`PodSpec`). When you apply a taint to a node, the scheduler cannot place a pod on that node unless the pod can tolerate the taint.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example taint in a node specification

</div>

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Node
metadata:
  name: my-node
#...
spec:
  taints:
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: key1
    value: value1
#...

<div wrapper="1" role="small">

1.  If you add a `NoSchedule` taint to a control plane node, the node must have the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=:NoSchedule` taint, which is added by default.

    For example:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Node
    metadata:
      annotations:
        machine.openshift.io/machine: openshift-machine-api/ci-ln-62s7gtb-f76d1-v8jxv-master-0
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/currentConfig: rendered-master-cdc1ab7da414629332cc4c3926e6e59c
      name: my-node
    #...
    spec:
      taints:
      - effect: NoSchedule
        key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    #...
    ```

</div>

A toleration matches a taint:

- If the `operator` parameter is set to `Equal`:

  - the `key` parameters are the same;

  - the `value` parameters are the same;

  - the `effect` parameters are the same.

- If the `operator` parameter is set to `Exists`:

  - the `key` parameters are the same;

  - the `effect` parameters are the same.

The following taints are built into OpenShift Container Platform:

- `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready`: The node is not ready. This corresponds to the node condition `Ready=False`.

- `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable`: The node is unreachable from the node controller. This corresponds to the node condition `Ready=Unknown`.

- `node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure`: The node has memory pressure issues. This corresponds to the node condition `MemoryPressure=True`.

- `node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure`: The node has disk pressure issues. This corresponds to the node condition `DiskPressure=True`.

- `node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable`: The node network is unavailable.

- `node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable`: The node is unschedulable.

- `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized`: When the node controller is started with an external cloud provider, this taint is set on a node to mark it as unusable. After a controller from the cloud-controller-manager initializes this node, the kubelet removes this taint.

- `node.kubernetes.io/pid-pressure`: The node has pid pressure. This corresponds to the node condition `PIDPressure=True`.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > OpenShift Container Platform does not set a default pid.available `evictionHard`.

## Adding taints and tolerations

You add tolerations to pods and taints to nodes to allow the node to control which pods should or should not be scheduled on them. For existing pods and nodes, you should add the toleration to the pod first, then add the taint to the node to avoid pods being removed from the node before you can add the toleration.

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Add a toleration to a pod by editing the `Pod` spec to include a `tolerations` stanza:

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Sample pod configuration file with an Equal operator

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-pod
    #...
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        value: "value1"
        operator: "Equal"
        effect: "NoExecute"
        tolerationSeconds: 3600
    #...
    ```

    </div>

    - The toleration parameters, as described in the **Taint and toleration components** table.

    - The `tolerationSeconds` parameter specifies how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted.

      For example:

      <div class="formalpara">

      <div class="title">

      Sample pod configuration file with an Exists operator

      </div>

      ``` yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        name: my-pod
      #...
      spec:
         tolerations:
          - key: "key1"
            operator: "Exists"
            effect: "NoExecute"
            tolerationSeconds: 3600
      #...
      ```

      </div>

    - The `Exists` operator does not take a `value`.

      This example places a taint on `node1` that has key `key1`, value `value1`, and taint effect `NoExecute`.

2.  Add a taint to a node by using the following command with the parameters described in the **Taint and toleration components** table:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc adm taint nodes <node_name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
    ```

    For example:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoExecute
    ```

    This command places a taint on `node1` that has key `key1`, value `value1`, and effect `NoExecute`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you add a `NoSchedule` taint to a control plane node, the node must have the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=:NoSchedule` taint, which is added by default.
    >
    > For example:
    >
    > ``` yaml
    > apiVersion: v1
    > kind: Node
    > metadata:
    >   annotations:
    >     machine.openshift.io/machine: openshift-machine-api/ci-ln-62s7gtb-f76d1-v8jxv-master-0
    >     machineconfiguration.openshift.io/currentConfig: rendered-master-cdc1ab7da414629332cc4c3926e6e59c

    >   taints:
    >   - effect: NoSchedule
    >     key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    > #...
    > ```

    The tolerations on the pod match the taint on the node. A pod with either toleration can be scheduled onto `node1`.

</div>

## Adding taints and tolerations using a compute machine set

You can add taints to nodes using a compute machine set. All nodes associated with the `MachineSet` object are updated with the taint. Tolerations respond to taints added by a compute machine set in the same manner as taints added directly to the nodes.

    <div class="title">

    Sample pod configuration file with `Equal` operator

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-pod
    #...
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        value: "value1"
        operator: "Equal"
        effect: "NoExecute"
        tolerationSeconds: 3600
    #...
    ```

    </div>

    - The toleration parameters, as described in the **Taint and toleration components** table.

    - The `tolerationSeconds` parameter specifies how long a pod is bound to a node before being evicted.

      For example:

      <div class="formalpara">

      <div class="title">

      Sample pod configuration file with `Exists` operator

      </div>

      ``` yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        name: my-pod
      #...
      spec:
        tolerations:
        - key: "key1"
          operator: "Exists"
          effect: "NoExecute"
          tolerationSeconds: 3600
      #...
      ```

      </div>

2.  Add the taint to the `MachineSet` object:

    1.  Edit the `MachineSet` YAML for the nodes you want to taint or you can create a new `MachineSet` object:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc edit machineset <machineset>
        ```

    2.  Add the taint to the `spec.template.spec` section:

        <div class="formalpara">

        <div class="title">

        Example taint in a compute machine set specification

        </div>

        ``` yaml
        apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
        kind: MachineSet
        metadata:
          name: my-machineset
        #...
        spec:
        #...
          template:
        #...
            spec:
              taints:
              - effect: NoExecute
                key: key1
                value: value1
        #...
        ```

        </div>

        This example places a taint that has the key `key1`, value `value1`, and taint effect `NoExecute` on the nodes.

    3.  Scale down the compute machine set to 0:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc scale --replicas=0 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
        ```

        > [!TIP]
        > You can alternatively apply the following YAML to scale the compute machine set:
        >
        > ``` yaml
        > apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
        > kind: MachineSet
        > metadata:
        >   name: <machineset>
        >   namespace: openshift-machine-api
        > spec:
        >   replicas: 0
        > ```

        Wait for the machines to be removed.

    4.  Scale up the compute machine set as needed:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
        ```

        Or:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
        ```

        Wait for the machines to start. The taint is added to the nodes associated with the `MachineSet` object.

</div>

## Binding a user to a node using taints and tolerations

If you want to dedicate a set of nodes for exclusive use by a particular set of users, add a toleration to their pods. Then, add a corresponding taint to those nodes. The pods with the tolerations are allowed to use the tainted nodes or any other nodes in the cluster.

If you want ensure the pods are scheduled to only those tainted nodes, also add a label to the same set of nodes and add a node affinity to the pods so that the pods can only be scheduled onto nodes with that label.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

To configure a node so that users can use only that node:

</div>

1.  Add a corresponding taint to those nodes:

    For example:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc adm taint nodes node1 dedicated=groupName:NoSchedule
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the taint:
    >
    > ``` yaml
    > kind: Node
    > apiVersion: v1
    > metadata:
    >   name: my-node
    > #...
    > spec:
    >   taints:
    >     - key: dedicated
    >       value: groupName
    >       effect: NoSchedule
    > #...
    > ```

2.  Add a toleration to the pods by writing a custom admission controller.

## Controlling nodes with special hardware using taints and tolerations

In a cluster where a small subset of nodes have specialized hardware, you can use taints and tolerations to keep pods that do not need the specialized hardware off of those nodes, leaving the nodes for pods that do need the specialized hardware. You can also require pods that need specialized hardware to use specific nodes.

You can achieve this by adding a toleration to pods that need the special hardware and tainting the nodes that have the specialized hardware.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

To ensure nodes with specialized hardware are reserved for specific pods:

</div>

1.  Add a toleration to pods that need the special hardware.

    For example:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-pod
    #...
    spec:
      tolerations:
        - key: "disktype"
          value: "ssd"
          operator: "Equal"
          effect: "NoSchedule"
          tolerationSeconds: 3600
    #...
    ```

2.  Taint the nodes that have the specialized hardware using one of the following commands:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd:NoSchedule
    ```

    Or:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd:PreferNoSchedule
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the taint:
    >
    > ``` yaml
    > kind: Node
    > apiVersion: v1
    > metadata:
    >   name: my_node
    > #...
    > spec:
    >   taints:
    >     - key: disktype
    >       value: ssd
    >       effect: PreferNoSchedule
    > #...
    > ```

## Removing taints and tolerations

You can remove taints from nodes and tolerations from pods as needed. You should add the toleration to the pod first, then add the taint to the node to avoid pods being removed from the node before you can add the toleration.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

To remove taints and tolerations:

</div>

1.  To remove a taint from a node:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> <key>-
    ```

    For example:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc adm taint nodes ip-10-0-132-248.ec2.internal key1-
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example output

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    node/ip-10-0-132-248.ec2.internal untainted
    ```

    </div>

2.  To remove a toleration from a pod, edit the `Pod` spec to remove the toleration:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-pod
    #...
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key2"
        operator: "Exists"
        effect: "NoExecute"
        tolerationSeconds: 3600
    #...
    ```

# Topology Manager

Understand and work with Topology Manager.

## Topology Manager policies

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Topology Manager aligns `Pod` resources of all Quality of Service (QoS) classes by collecting topology hints from Hint Providers, such as CPU Manager and Device Manager, and using the collected hints to align the `Pod` resources.

</div>

Topology Manager supports four allocation policies, which you assign in the `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) named `cpumanager-enabled`:

`none` policy
This is the default policy and does not perform any topology alignment.

`best-effort` policy
For each container in a pod with the `best-effort` topology management policy, kubelet tries to align all the required resources on a NUMA node according to the preferred NUMA node affinity for that container. Even if the allocation is not possible due to insufficient resources, the Topology Manager still admits the pod but the allocation is shared with other NUMA nodes.

`restricted` policy
For each container in a pod with the `restricted` topology management policy, kubelet determines the theoretical minimum number of NUMA nodes that can fulfill the request. If the actual allocation requires more than the that number of NUMA nodes, the Topology Manager rejects the admission, placing the pod in a `Terminated` state. If the number of NUMA nodes can fulfill the request, the Topology Manager admits the pod and the pod starts running.

`single-numa-node` policy
For each container in a pod with the `single-numa-node` topology management policy, kubelet admits the pod if all the resources required by the pod can be allocated on the same NUMA node. If a single NUMA node affinity is not possible, the Topology Manager rejects the pod from the node. This results in a pod in a `Terminated` state with a pod admission failure.

## Setting up Topology Manager

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To use Topology Manager, you must configure an allocation policy in the `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) named `cpumanager-enabled`. This file might exist if you have set up CPU Manager. If the file does not exist, you can create the file.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- Configure the CPU Manager policy to be `static`.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  To activate Topology Manager, configure the Topology Manager allocation policy in the custom resource.

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit KubeletConfig cpumanager-enabled
    ```

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: KubeletConfig
    metadata:
      name: cpumanager-enabled
    spec:
      machineConfigPoolSelector:
        matchLabels:
          custom-kubelet: cpumanager-enabled
      kubeletConfig:
         cpuManagerPolicy: static
         cpuManagerReconcilePeriod: 5s
         topologyManagerPolicy: single-numa-node
    ```

    - `cpuManagerPolicy` must be `static` with a lowercase `s`.

    - `topologyManagerPolicy` specifies your selected Topology Manager allocation policy. In this example, the policy is `single-numa-node`. Acceptable values are: `default`, `best-effort`, `restricted`, `single-numa-node`.

</div>

## Pod interactions with Topology Manager policies

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

The example `Pod` specs illustrate pod interactions with Topology Manager.

</div>

The following pod runs in the `BestEffort` QoS class because no resource requests or limits are specified.

``` yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

The next pod runs in the `Burstable` QoS class because requests are less than limits.

``` yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
      requests:
        memory: "100Mi"
```

If the selected policy is anything other than `none`, Topology Manager would process all the pods and it enforces resource alignment only for the `Guaranteed` QoS `Pod` specification. When the Topology Manager policy is set to `none`, the relevant containers are pinned to any available CPU without considering NUMA affinity. This is the default behavior and it does not optimize for performance-sensitive workloads. Other values enable the use of topology awareness information from device plugins core resources, such as CPU and memory. The Topology Manager attempts to align the CPU, memory, and device allocations according to the topology of the node when the policy is set to other values than `none`. For more information about the available values, see *Topology Manager policies*.

The following example pod runs in the `Guaranteed` QoS class because requests are equal to limits.

``` yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
```

Topology Manager would consider this pod. The Topology Manager would consult the Hint Providers, which are the CPU Manager, the Device Manager, and the Memory Manager, to get topology hints for the pod.

Topology Manager will use this information to store the best topology for this container. In the case of this pod, CPU Manager and Device Manager will use this stored information at the resource allocation stage.

# Resource requests and overcommitment

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use resource requests in an overcommitted environment help you ensure that your cluster is properly configured.

</div>

For each compute resource, a container can specify a resource request and limit. Scheduling decisions are made based on the request to ensure that a node has enough capacity available to meet the requested value. If a container specifies limits, but omits requests, the requests are defaulted to the limits. A container is not able to exceed the specified limit on the node.

The enforcement of limits is dependent upon the compute resource type. If a container makes no request or limit, the container is scheduled to a node with no resource guarantees. In practice, the container is able to consume as much of the specified resource as is available with the lowest local priority. In low resource situations, containers that specify no resource requests are given the lowest quality of service.

Scheduling is based on resources requested, where quota and hard limits refer to resource limits, which can be set higher than requested resources. The difference between the request and the limit determines the level of overcommit. For example, if a container is given a memory request of 1Gi and a memory limit of 2Gi, the container is scheduled based on the 1Gi request being available on the node, but could use up to 2Gi; so it is 100% overcommitted.

# Cluster-level overcommit using the Cluster Resource Override Operator

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use the Cluster Resource Override Operator to control the level of overcommit and manage container density across all the nodes in your cluster. The Operator, which is an admission webhook, controls how nodes in specific projects can exceed defined memory and CPU limits.

</div>

The Operator modifies the ratio between the requests and limits that are set on developer containers. In conjunction with a per-project limit range that specifies limits and defaults, you can achieve the desired level of overcommit.

You must install the Cluster Resource Override Operator by using the OpenShift Container Platform console or CLI as shown in the following sections. After you deploy the Cluster Resource Override Operator, the Operator modifies all new pods in specific namespaces. The Operator does not edit pods that existed before you deployed the Operator.

During the installation, you create a `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource (CR), where you set the level of overcommit, as shown in the following example:

``` yaml
apiVersion: operator.autoscaling.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
    name: cluster
spec:
  podResourceOverride:
    spec:
      memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 50
      cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25
      limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200
# ...
```

where:

`metadata.name`
Specifies a name for the object. The name must be `cluster`.

`spec.podResourceOverride.spec.memoryRequestToLimitPercent`
If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the memory request is overridden to this percentage of the limit, between 1-100. The default is 50.

`spec.podResourceOverride.spec.cpuRequestToLimitPercent`
If a container CPU limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU request is overridden to this percentage of the limit, between 1-100. The default is 25.

`spec.podResourceOverride.spec.limitCPUToMemoryPercent`
If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU limit is overridden to a percentage of the memory limit, if specified. Scaling 1Gi of RAM at 100 percent is equal to 1 CPU core. This is processed before overriding the CPU request (if configured). The default is 200.

> [!NOTE]
> The Cluster Resource Override Operator overrides have no effect if limits have not been set on containers. Create a `LimitRange` object with default limits per individual project or configure limits in `Pod` specs for the overrides to apply.

When configured, you can enable overrides on a per-project basis by applying the following label to the `Namespace` object for each project where you want the overrides to apply. For example, you can configure override so that infrastructure components are not subject to the overrides.

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:

# ...

  labels:
    clusterresourceoverrides.admission.autoscaling.openshift.io/enabled: "true"

# ...
```

The Operator watches for the `ClusterResourceOverride` CR and ensures that the `ClusterResourceOverride` admission webhook is installed into the same namespace as the operator.

For example, a pod has the following resources limits:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  namespace: my-namespace
# ...
spec:
  containers:
    - name: hello-openshift
      image: openshift/hello-openshift
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: "512Mi"
          cpu: "2000m"
# ...
```

The Cluster Resource Override Operator intercepts the original pod request, then overrides the resources according to the configuration set in the `ClusterResourceOverride` object.

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  namespace: my-namespace
# ...
spec:
  containers:
  - image: openshift/hello-openshift
    name: hello-openshift
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: 512Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 256Mi
# ...
```

where:

`spec.containers.resources.limits.cpu`
Specifies that the CPU limit has been overridden to `1` because the `limitCPUToMemoryPercent` parameter is set to `200` in the `ClusterResourceOverride` object. As such, 200% of the memory limit, 512Mi in CPU terms, is 1 CPU core.

`spec.containers.resources.memory.cpu`
Specifies that the CPU request is now `250m` because the `cpuRequestToLimit` is set to `25` in the `ClusterResourceOverride` object. As such, 25% of the 1 CPU core is 250m.

## Installing the Cluster Resource Override Operator using the web console

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform web console to install the Cluster Resource Override Operator to help you control overcommit in your cluster.

        ```

    2.  Create the namespace:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
        ```

        For example:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc create -f cro-namespace.yaml
        ```

2.  Create an Operator group:

    1.  Create an `OperatorGroup` object YAML file (for example, cro-og.yaml) for the Cluster Resource Override Operator:

        ``` yaml
        apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
        kind: OperatorGroup
        metadata:
          name: clusterresourceoverride-operator
          namespace: clusterresourceoverride-operator
        spec:
          targetNamespaces:
            - clusterresourceoverride-operator
        ```

    2.  Create the Operator Group:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml

        $ oc create -f cro-og.yaml
        ```

3.  Create a subscription:

    1.  Create a `Subscription` object YAML file (for example, cro-sub.yaml) for the Cluster Resource Override Operator:

        ``` yaml
        apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
        kind: Subscription
        metadata:
          name: clusterresourceoverride

    1.  Change to the `clusterresourceoverride-operator` namespace.

        ``` terminal
        $ oc project clusterresourceoverride-operator
        ```

    2.  Create a `ClusterResourceOverride` object YAML file (for example, cro-cr.yaml) for the Cluster Resource Override Operator:

              cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25
              limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200
        ```

        where

        `metadata.name`
        Specifies a name for the CR. The name must be `cluster`.

        `spec.podResourceOverride.spec.memoryRequestToLimitPercent`
        Specifies the percentage to override the container memory limit, if used, between 1-100. The default is `50`. This parameter is optional.

        Specifies the percentage to override the container memory limit, if used. Scaling 1 Gi of RAM at 100 percent is equal to 1 CPU core. This is processed before overriding the CPU request, if configured. The default is `200`. This parameter is optional.

    3.  Create the `ClusterResourceOverride` object:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml

## Configuring cluster-level overcommit

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use the OpenShift CLI to configure the Cluster Resource Override Operator to help control overcommit in your cluster.

</div>

The Cluster Resource Override Operator requires a `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource (CR) and a label for each project where you want the Operator to control overcommit.

By default, the installation process creates two Cluster Resource Override pods on the control plane nodes in the `clusterresourceoverride-operator` namespace. You can move these pods to other nodes, such as infrastructure nodes, as needed. Infrastructure nodes are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment. For more information, see "Moving the Cluster Resource Override Operator pods".

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- The Cluster Resource Override Operator has no effect if limits have not been set on containers. You must specify default limits for a project using a `LimitRange` object or configure limits in `Pod` specs for the overrides to apply.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Edit the `ClusterResourceOverride` CR:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: operator.autoscaling.openshift.io/v1
    kind: ClusterResourceOverride
    metadata:
        name: cluster
    spec:
      podResourceOverride:
        spec:
          memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 50
          cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25
          limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `spec.podResourceOverride.spec.memoryRequestToLimitPercent`
    Specifies the percentage to override the container memory limit, if used, between 1-100. The default is `50`. This parameter is optional.

    `spec.podResourceOverride.spec.cpuRequestToLimitPercent`
    Specifies the percentage to override the container CPU limit, if used, between 1-100. The default is `25`. This parameter is optional.

    `spec.podResourceOverride.spec.limitCPUToMemoryPercent`
    Specifies the percentage to override the container memory limit, if used. Scaling 1Gi of RAM at 100 percent is equal to 1 CPU core. This is processed before overriding the CPU request, if configured. The default is `200`. This parameter is optional.

2.  Ensure the following label has been added to the Namespace object for each project where you want the Cluster Resource Override Operator to control overcommit:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:

    # ...

      labels:
        clusterresourceoverrides.admission.autoscaling.openshift.io/enabled: "true"

    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `metadata.labels.clusterresourceoverrides.admission.autoscaling.openshift.io/enabled: "true"`
    Specifies that you want to use the Cluster Resource Override Operator with this project.

</div>

# Node-level overcommit

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use various ways to control overcommit on specific nodes, such as quality of service (QOS) guarantees, CPU limits, or reserve resources. You can also disable overcommit for specific nodes and specific projects.

</div>

## Understanding container CPU and memory requests

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Review the following information to learn about container CPU and memory requests to help you ensure that your cluster is properly configured.

</div>

A container is guaranteed the amount of CPU it requests and is additionally able to consume excess CPU available on the node, up to any limit specified by the container. If multiple containers are attempting to use excess CPU, CPU time is distributed based on the amount of CPU requested by each container.

For example, if one container requested 500m of CPU time and another container requested 250m of CPU time, any extra CPU time available on the node is distributed among the containers in a 2:1 ratio. If a container specified a limit, it will be throttled not to use more CPU than the specified limit. CPU requests are enforced using the CFS shares support in the Linux kernel. By default, CPU limits are enforced using the CFS quota support in the Linux kernel over a 100ms measuring interval, though this can be disabled.

A container is guaranteed the amount of memory it requests. A container can use more memory than requested, but once it exceeds its requested amount, it could be terminated in a low memory situation on the node. If a container uses less memory than requested, it will not be terminated unless system tasks or daemons need more memory than was accounted for in the node’s resource reservation. If a container specifies a limit on memory, it is immediately terminated if it exceeds the limit amount.

## Understanding overcommitment and quality of service classes

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use Quality of Service (QoS) classes in an overcommitted environment to help you ensure that your cluster is properly configured.

</div>

A node is *overcommitted* when it has a pod scheduled that makes no request, or when the sum of limits across all pods on that node exceeds available machine capacity.

In an overcommitted environment, the pods on the node might attempt to use more compute resource than is available at any given point in time. When this occurs, the node must give priority to one pod over another. The facility used to make this decision is referred to as a Quality of Service (QoS) class.

A pod is designated as one of three QoS classes with decreasing order of priority:

| Priority | Class Name | Description |
|----|----|----|
| 1 (highest) | **Guaranteed** | If limits and optionally requests are set (not equal to 0) for all resources and they are equal, then the pod is classified as **Guaranteed**. |
| 2 | **Burstable** | If requests and optionally limits are set (not equal to 0) for all resources, and they are not equal, then the pod is classified as **Burstable**. |
| 3 (lowest) | **BestEffort** | If requests and limits are not set for any of the resources, then the pod is classified as **BestEffort**. |

Quality of Service classes

Memory is an incompressible resource, so in low memory situations, containers that have the lowest priority are terminated first:

- **Guaranteed** containers are considered top priority, and are guaranteed to only be terminated if they exceed their limits, or if the system is under memory pressure and there are no lower priority containers that can be evicted.

- **Burstable** containers under system memory pressure are more likely to be terminated when they exceed their requests and no other **BestEffort** containers exist.

- **BestEffort** containers are treated with the lowest priority. Processes in these containers are first to be terminated if the system runs out of memory.

### Understanding how to reserve memory across quality of service tiers

You can use the `qos-reserved` parameter to specify a percentage of memory to be reserved by a pod in a particular QoS level. This feature attempts to reserve requested resources to exclude pods from lower QoS classes from using resources requested by pods in higher QoS classes.

OpenShift Container Platform uses the `qos-reserved` parameter as follows:

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=100%` prevents the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes from consuming memory that was requested by a higher QoS class. This increases the risk of inducing OOM on `BestEffort` and `Burstable` workloads in favor of increasing memory resource guarantees for `Guaranteed` and `Burstable` workloads.

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=50%` allows the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes to consume half of the memory requested by a higher QoS class.

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=0%` allows a `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes to consume up to the full node allocatable amount if available, but increases the risk that a `Guaranteed` workload does not have access to requested memory. This condition effectively disables this feature.

## Understanding swap memory and QoS

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Review the following information to learn how swap memory and QoS interact in an overcommitted environment to help you ensure that your cluster is properly configured.

</div>

You can disable swap by default on your nodes to preserve quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Otherwise, physical resources on a node can oversubscribe, affecting the resource guarantees the Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod placement.

For example, if two guaranteed pods have reached their memory limit, each container could start using swap memory. Eventually, if there is not enough swap space, processes in the pods can be terminated due to the system being oversubscribed.

Failing to disable swap causes nodes to not recognize that they are experiencing **MemoryPressure**, resulting in pods not receiving the memory they made in their scheduling request. As a result, additional pods are placed on the node to further increase memory pressure, ultimately increasing your risk of experiencing a system out of memory (OOM) event.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If swap is enabled, any out-of-resource handling eviction thresholds for available memory will not work as expected. Out-of-resource handling allows pods to be evicted from a node when it is under memory pressure, and rescheduled on an alternative node that has no such pressure.

## Understanding nodes overcommitment

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To maintain optimal system performance and stability in an overcommitted environment in OpenShift Container Platform, configure your nodes to manage resource contention effectively.

</div>

When the node starts, it ensures that the kernel tunable flags for memory management are set properly. The kernel should never fail memory allocations unless it runs out of physical memory.

To ensure this behavior, OpenShift Container Platform configures the kernel to always overcommit memory by setting the `vm.overcommit_memory` parameter to `1`, overriding the default operating system setting.

OpenShift Container Platform also configures the kernel to not panic when it runs out of memory by setting the `vm.panic_on_oom` parameter to `0`. A setting of 0 instructs the kernel to call the OOM killer in an Out of Memory (OOM) condition, which kills processes based on priority.

You can view the current setting by running the following commands on your nodes:

``` terminal
$ sysctl -a |grep commit
```

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example output

</div>

``` terminal
#...
vm.overcommit_memory = 0
#...
```

</div>

``` terminal
$ sysctl -a |grep panic
```

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example output

</div>

``` terminal
#...
vm.panic_on_oom = 0
#...
```

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> The previous commands should already be set on nodes, so no further action is required.

You can also perform the following configurations for each node:

- Disable or enforce CPU limits using CPU CFS quotas

- Reserve resources for system processes

- Reserve memory across quality of service tiers

## Disabling or enforcing CPU limits using CPU CFS quotas

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can disable the default enforcement of CPU limits for nodes in a machine config pool.

</div>

By default, nodes enforce specified CPU limits using the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota support in the Linux kernel.

If you disable CPU limit enforcement, it is important to understand the impact on your node:

- If a container has a CPU request, the request continues to be enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel.

- If a container does not have a CPU request, but does have a CPU limit, the CPU request defaults to the specified CPU limit, and is enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel.

- If a container has both a CPU request and limit, the CPU request is enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel, and the CPU limit has no impact on the node.

# Freeing node resources using garbage collection

Understand and use garbage collection.

## Understanding how terminated containers are removed through garbage collection

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can help ensure that your nodes are running efficiently by using container garbage collection to remove terminated containers.

</div>

When eviction thresholds are set for garbage collection, the node tries to keep any container for any pod accessible from the API. If the pod has been deleted, the containers will be as well. Containers are preserved as long the pod is not deleted and the eviction threshold is not reached. If the node is under disk pressure, it will remove containers and their logs will no longer be accessible using `oc logs`.

- **eviction-soft** - A soft eviction threshold pairs an eviction threshold with a required administrator-specified grace period.

- **eviction-hard** - A hard eviction threshold has no grace period, and if observed, OpenShift Container Platform takes immediate action.

The following table lists the eviction thresholds:

<table>
<caption>Variables for configuring container garbage collection</caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>

<th style="text-align: left;">Node condition</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Eviction signal</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>MemoryPressure</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><code>memory.available</code></p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>The available memory on the node.</p></td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>DiskPressure</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><ul>
<li><p><code>nodefs.available</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>nodefs.inodesFree</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>imagefs.available</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>imagefs.inodesFree</code></p></li>
</ul></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>The available disk space or inodes on the node root file system, <code>nodefs</code>, or image file system, <code>imagefs</code>.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> For `evictionHard` you must specify all of these parameters. If you do not specify all parameters, only the specified parameters are applied and the garbage collection will not function properly.

If a node is oscillating above and below a soft eviction threshold, but not exceeding its associated grace period, the corresponding node would constantly oscillate between `true` and `false`. As a consequence, the scheduler could make poor scheduling decisions.

To protect against this oscillation, use the `evictionpressure-transition-period` flag to control how long OpenShift Container Platform must wait before transitioning out of a pressure condition. OpenShift Container Platform will not set an eviction threshold as being met for the specified pressure condition for the period specified before toggling the condition back to false.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the `evictionPressureTransitionPeriod` parameter to `0` configures the default value of 5 minutes. You cannot set an eviction pressure transition period to zero seconds.

## Understanding how images are removed through garbage collection

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can help ensure that your nodes are running efficiently by using image garbage collection to removes images that are not referenced by any running pods.

</div>

OpenShift Container Platform determines which images to remove from a node based on the disk usage that is reported by **cAdvisor**.

The policy for image garbage collection is based on two conditions:

- The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) which triggers image garbage collection. The default is **85**.

- The percent of disk usage (expressed as an integer) to which image garbage collection attempts to free. Default is **80**.

For image garbage collection, you can modify any of the following variables using a custom resource.

| Setting | Description |
|----|----|
| `imageMinimumGCAge` | The minimum age for an unused image before the image is removed by garbage collection. The default is **2m**. |
| `imageGCHighThresholdPercent` | The percent of disk usage, expressed as an integer, which triggers image garbage collection. The default is **85**. This value must be greater than the `imageGCLowThresholdPercent` value. |
| `imageGCLowThresholdPercent` | The percent of disk usage, expressed as an integer, to which image garbage collection attempts to free. The default is **80**. This value must be less than the `imageGCHighThresholdPercent` value. |

Variables for configuring image garbage collection

Two lists of images are retrieved in each garbage collector run:

1.  A list of images currently running in at least one pod.

2.  A list of images available on a host.

As new containers are run, new images appear. All images are marked with a time stamp. If the image is running (the first list above) or is newly detected (the second list above), it is marked with the current time. The remaining images are already marked from the previous spins. All images are then sorted by the time stamp.

Once the collection starts, the oldest images get deleted first until the stopping criterion is met.

## Configuring garbage collection for containers and images

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

As an administrator, you can configure how OpenShift Container Platform performs garbage collection by creating a `kubeletConfig` object for each machine config pool. Performing garbage collection helps ensure that your nodes are running efficiently.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> OpenShift Container Platform supports only one `kubeletConfig` object for each machine config pool.

You can configure any combination of the following:

- Soft eviction for containers

- Hard eviction for containers

- Eviction for images

Container garbage collection removes terminated containers. Image garbage collection removes images that are not referenced by any running pods.

# Using the Node Tuning Operator

Understand and use the Node Tuning Operator.

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the TuneD daemon and achieves low latency performance by using the Performance Profile controller. The majority of high-performance applications require some level of kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management interface to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning specified by user needs.

</div>

The Operator manages the containerized TuneD daemon for OpenShift Container Platform as a Kubernetes daemon set. It ensures the custom tuning specification is passed to all containerized TuneD daemons running in the cluster in the format that the daemons understand. The daemons run on all nodes in the cluster, one per node.

Node-level settings applied by the containerized TuneD daemon are rolled back on an event that triggers a profile change or when the containerized TuneD daemon is terminated gracefully by receiving and handling a termination signal.

The Node Tuning Operator uses the Performance Profile controller to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift Container Platform applications.

The cluster administrator configures a performance profile to define node-level settings such as the following:

- Updating the kernel to kernel-rt.

- Choosing CPUs for housekeeping.

- Choosing CPUs for running workloads.

The Node Tuning Operator is part of a standard OpenShift Container Platform installation in version 4.1 and later.

> [!NOTE]
> In earlier versions of OpenShift Container Platform, the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 and later, this functionality is part of the Node Tuning Operator.

## Accessing an example Node Tuning Operator specification

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Use this process to access an example Node Tuning Operator specification.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- Run the following command to access an example Node Tuning Operator specification:

  ``` terminal
  oc get tuned.tuned.openshift.io/default -o yaml -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
  ```

  The default CR is meant for delivering standard node-level tuning for the OpenShift Container Platform platform and it can only be modified to set the Operator Management state. Any other custom changes to the default CR will be overwritten by the Operator. For custom tuning, create your own Tuned CRs. Newly created CRs will be combined with the default CR and custom tuning applied to OpenShift Container Platform nodes based on node or pod labels and profile priorities.

  > [!WARNING]
  > While in certain situations the support for pod labels can be a convenient way of automatically delivering required tuning, this practice is discouraged and strongly advised against, especially in large-scale clusters. The default Tuned CR ships without pod label matching. If a custom profile is created with pod label matching, then the functionality will be enabled at that time. The pod label functionality will be deprecated in future versions of the Node Tuning Operator.

</div>

## Custom tuning specification

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

The custom resource (CR) for the Operator has two major sections. The first section, `profile:`, is a list of TuneD profiles and their names. The second, `recommend:`, defines the profile selection logic.

</div>

Multiple custom tuning specifications can co-exist as multiple CRs in the Operator’s namespace. The existence of new CRs or the deletion of old CRs is detected by the Operator. All existing custom tuning specifications are merged and appropriate objects for the containerized TuneD daemons are updated.

**Management state**

The Operator Management state is set by adjusting the default Tuned CR. By default, the Operator is in the Managed state and the `spec.managementState` field is not present in the default Tuned CR. Valid values for the Operator Management state are as follows:

- Managed: the Operator will update its operands as configuration resources are updated

- Unmanaged: the Operator will ignore changes to the configuration resources

- Removed: the Operator will remove its operands and resources the Operator provisioned

**Profile data**

The `profile:` section lists TuneD profiles and their names.

``` yaml
profile:
- name: tuned_profile_1
  data: |
    # TuneD profile specification
    [main]
    summary=Description of tuned_profile_1 profile

    [sysctl]
    net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    # ... other sysctl's or other TuneD daemon plugins supported by the containerized TuneD

# ...

- name: tuned_profile_n
  data: |
    # TuneD profile specification
    [main]
    summary=Description of tuned_profile_n profile

    # tuned_profile_n profile settings
```

**Recommended profiles**

The `profile:` selection logic is defined by the `recommend:` section of the CR. The `recommend:` section is a list of items to recommend the profiles based on a selection criteria.

``` yaml
recommend:
<recommend-item-1>
# ...
<recommend-item-n>
```

The individual items of the list:

``` yaml
- machineConfigLabels:
    <mcLabels>
  match:
    <match>
  priority: <priority>
  profile: <tuned_profile_name>
  operand:
    debug: <bool>
    tunedConfig:
      reapply_sysctl: <bool>
```

where:

- `machineConfigLabels`: Optional.

- `<mcLabels>`: A dictionary of key/value `MachineConfig` labels. The keys must be unique.

- `match`: If omitted, profile match is assumed unless a profile with a higher priority matches first or `machineConfigLabels` is set.

- `<match>`: An optional list.

- `<priority>`: Profile ordering priority. Lower numbers mean higher priority (`0` is the highest priority).

- `<tuned_profile_name>`: A TuneD profile to apply on a match. For example `tuned_profile_1`.

- `operand`: Optional operand configuration.

- `debug`: Turn debugging on or off for the TuneD daemon. Options are `true` for on or `false` for off. The default is `false`.

- `reapply_sysctl`: Turn `reapply_sysctl` functionality on or off for the TuneD daemon. Options are `true` for on and `false` for off.

`<match>` is an optional list recursively defined as follows:

``` yaml
- label: <label_name>
  value: <label_value>
  type: <label_type>
    <match>
```

where:

- `<label_name>`: Node or pod label name.

- `<label_value>`: Optional node or pod label value. If omitted, the presence of `<label_name>` is enough to match.

- `<label_type>`: Optional object type (`node` or `pod`). If omitted, `node` is assumed.

- `<match>`: An optional `<match>` list.

If `<match>` is not omitted, all nested `<match>` sections must also evaluate to `true`. Otherwise, `false` is assumed and the profile with the respective `<match>` section will not be applied or recommended. Therefore, the nesting (child `<match>` sections) works as logical AND operator. Conversely, if any item of the `<match>` list matches, the entire `<match>` list evaluates to `true`. Therefore, the list acts as logical OR operator.

If `machineConfigLabels` is defined, machine config pool based matching is turned on for the given `recommend:` list item. `<mcLabels>` specifies the labels for a machine config. The machine config is created automatically to apply host settings, such as kernel boot parameters, for the profile `<tuned_profile_name>`. This involves finding all machine config pools with machine config selector matching `<mcLabels>` and setting the profile `<tuned_profile_name>` on all nodes that are assigned the found machine config pools. To target nodes that have both master and worker roles, you must use the master role.

The list items `match` and `machineConfigLabels` are connected by the logical OR operator. The `match` item is evaluated first in a short-circuit manner. Therefore, if it evaluates to `true`, the `machineConfigLabels` item is not considered.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using machine config pool based matching, it is advised to group nodes with the same hardware configuration into the same machine config pool. Not following this practice might result in TuneD operands calculating conflicting kernel parameters for two or more nodes sharing the same machine config pool.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example: Node or pod label based matching

</div>

``` yaml
- match:
  - label: tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch
    match:
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
    type: pod
  priority: 10
  profile: openshift-control-plane-es
- match:
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
  - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
  priority: 20
  profile: openshift-control-plane
- priority: 30
  profile: openshift-node
```

</div>

The CR above is translated for the containerized TuneD daemon into its `recommend.conf` file based on the profile priorities. The profile with the highest priority (`10`) is `openshift-control-plane-es` and, therefore, it is considered first. The containerized TuneD daemon running on a given node looks to see if there is a pod running on the same node with the `tuned.openshift.io/elasticsearch` label set. If not, the entire `<match>` section evaluates as `false`. If there is such a pod with the label, in order for the `<match>` section to evaluate to `true`, the node label also needs to be `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

If the labels for the profile with priority `10` matched, `openshift-control-plane-es` profile is applied and no other profile is considered. If the node/pod label combination did not match, the second highest priority profile (`openshift-control-plane`) is considered. This profile is applied if the containerized TuneD pod runs on a node with labels `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` or `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`.

Finally, the profile `openshift-node` has the lowest priority of `30`. It lacks the `<match>` section and, therefore, will always match. It acts as a profile catch-all to set `openshift-node` profile, if no other profile with higher priority matches on a given node.

Example: Machine config pool based matching

</div>

``` yaml
apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1
kind: Tuned
metadata:
  name: openshift-node-custom
  namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
spec:
  profile:
  - data: |

      summary=Custom OpenShift node profile with an additional kernel parameter
      include=openshift-node
      [bootloader]
      cmdline_openshift_node_custom=+skew_tick=1

  recommend:
  - machineConfigLabels:

```

</div>

To minimize node reboots, label the target nodes with a label the machine config pool’s node selector will match, then create the Tuned CR above and finally create the custom machine config pool itself.

**Cloud provider-specific TuneD profiles**

With this functionality, all Cloud provider-specific nodes can conveniently be assigned a TuneD profile specifically tailored to a given Cloud provider on a OpenShift Container Platform cluster. This can be accomplished without adding additional node labels or grouping nodes into machine config pools.

This functionality takes advantage of `spec.providerID` node object values in the form of `<cloud-provider>://<cloud-provider-specific-id>` and writes the file `/var/lib/ocp-tuned/provider` with the value `<cloud-provider>` in NTO operand containers. The content of this file is then used by TuneD to load `provider-<cloud-provider>` profile if such profile exists.

The `openshift` profile that both `openshift-control-plane` and `openshift-node` profiles inherit settings from is now updated to use this functionality through the use of conditional profile loading. Neither NTO nor TuneD currently include any Cloud provider-specific profiles. However, it is possible to create a custom profile `provider-<cloud-provider>` that will be applied to all Cloud provider-specific cluster nodes.

<div class="formalpara">

<div class="title">

Example GCE Cloud provider profile

</div>

``` yaml

      # Your tuning for GCE Cloud provider goes here.
    name: provider-gce
```

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> Due to profile inheritance, any setting specified in the `provider-<cloud-provider>` profile will be overwritten by the `openshift` profile and its child profiles.

## Default profiles set on a cluster

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

The following are the default profiles set on a cluster.

</div>

``` yaml
apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1
kind: Tuned
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
spec:
  profile:
  - data: |

    match:
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    - label: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
  - profile: openshift-node
    priority: 40
```

Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.9, all OpenShift TuneD profiles are shipped with the TuneD package. You can use the `oc exec` command to view the contents of these profiles:

``` terminal
$ oc exec $tuned_pod -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator -- find /usr/lib/tuned/openshift{,-control-plane,-node} -name tuned.conf -exec grep -H ^ {} \;
```

## Supported TuneD daemon plugins

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Excluding the `[main]` section, the following TuneD plugins are supported when using custom profiles defined in the `profile:` section of the Tuned CR:

</div>

- audio

- cpu

- disk

- eeepc_she

- modules

- mounts

- net

- scheduler

- scsi_host

- selinux

- sysctl

- sysfs

- usb

- video

- vm

- bootloader

There is some dynamic tuning functionality provided by some of these plugins that is not supported. The following TuneD plugins are currently not supported:

- script

- systemd

> [!NOTE]
> The TuneD bootloader plugin only supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) worker nodes.

# Configuring the maximum number of pods per node

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

You can use the `podsPerCore` and `maxPods` parameters in a kublet configuration to control the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled to a node. If you use both options, the lower of the two limits the number of pods on a node. Setting an appropriate maximum can help ensure your nodes run efficiently.

</div>

For example, if `podsPerCore` is set to `10` on a node with 4 processor cores, the maximum number of pods allowed on the node will be 40.

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CRD for the type of node you want to configure.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create a custom resource (CR) for your configuration change.

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Sample configuration for a `max-pods` CR

    </div>

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: KubeletConfig
    metadata:
      name: set-max-pods
    spec:
      machineConfigPoolSelector:
        matchLabels:
          pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: ""
      kubeletConfig:
        podsPerCore: 10
        maxPods: 250
    #...
    ```

    </div>

    where:

    `metadata.name`
    Specifies a name for the CR.

    `spec.machineConfigPoolSelector.matchLabels`
    Specifies the label from the machine config pool.

    `spec.kubeletConfig.podsPerCore`
    Specifies the number of pods the node can run based on the number of processor cores on the node.

    `spec.kubeletConfig.maxPods`
    Specifies the number of pods the node can run to a fixed value, regardless of the properties of the node.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Setting `podsPerCore` to `0` disables this limit.

    In the above example, the default value for `podsPerCore` is `10` and the default value for `maxPods` is `250`. This means that unless the node has 25 cores or more, by default, `podsPerCore` will be the limiting factor.

2.  Run the following command to create the CR:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
    ```

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

- List the `MachineConfigPool` CRDs to check if the change is applied. The `UPDATING` column reports `True` if the change is picked up by the Machine Config Controller:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get machineconfigpools
  ```

  <div class="formalpara">

  <div class="title">

  Example output

  </div>

  ``` terminal

  worker   worker-8cecd1236b33ee3f8a5e   False     True       False
  ```

  </div>

  After the change is complete, the `UPDATED` column reports `True`.

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get machineconfigpools
  ```

  <div class="formalpara">

  <div class="title">

  Example output

  </div>

    - The IP address for the default gateway for the network interface.

    - Lists IPv4, IPv6, or both IP addresses that installation program passes to the network interface. Both IP families must use the same network interface for the default network.

    - Lists a DNS nameserver. You can define up to 3 DNS nameservers. Consider defining more than one DNS nameserver to take advantage of DNS resolution if that one DNS nameserver becomes unreachable.

      - Create a `machine` custom resource (CR) by entering the following command in your terminal:

        ``` terminal
        $ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
        ```

## Machine set scaling of machines with configured static IP addresses

You can use a machine set to scale machines with configured static IP addresses.

After you configure a machine set to request a static IP address for a machine, the machine controller creates an `IPAddressClaim` resource in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace. The external controller then creates an `IPAddress` resource and binds any static IP addresses to the `IPAddressClaim` resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your organization might use numerous types of IP address management (IPAM) services. If you want to enable a particular IPAM service on OpenShift Container Platform, you might need to manually create the `IPAddressClaim` resource in a YAML definition and then bind a static IP address to this resource by entering the following command in your `oc` CLI:
>
> ``` terminal
> $ oc create -f <ipaddressclaim_filename>
> ```

The following demonstrates an example of an `IPAddressClaim` resource:

``` yaml
kind: IPAddressClaim
metadata:
  finalizers:
  - machine.openshift.io/ip-claim-protection
  name: cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  poolRef:
    apiGroup: ipamcontroller.example.io
    kind: IPPool
    name: static-ci-pool
status: {}
```

The machine controller updates the machine with a status of `IPAddressClaimed` to indicate that a static IP address has successfully bound to the `IPAddressClaim` resource. The machine controller applies the same status to a machine with multiple `IPAddressClaim` resources that each contain a bound static IP address.The machine controller then creates a virtual machine and applies static IP addresses to any nodes listed in the `providerSpec` of a machine’s configuration.

## Using a machine set to scale machines with configured static IP addresses

Procedure

</div>

1.  Configure a machine set by specifying IP pool information in the `network.devices.addressesFromPools` schema of the machine set’s YAML file:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
    kind: MachineSet
    metadata:
      annotations:
        machine.openshift.io/memoryMb: "8192"
        machine.openshift.io/vCPU: "4"
      labels:
        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: <infrastructure_id>
      name: <infrastructure_id>-<role>
      namespace: openshift-machine-api
    spec:
      replicas: 0
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: <infrastructure_id>
          machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset: <infrastructure_id>-<role>
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            ipam: "true"
            machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: <infrastructure_id>
            machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role: worker
            machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-type: worker
            machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset: <infrastructure_id>-<role>
        spec:
          lifecycleHooks: {}
          metadata: {}
          providerSpec:
            value:
              apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
              credentialsSecret:
                name: vsphere-cloud-credentials
              diskGiB: 120
              kind: VSphereMachineProviderSpec
              memoryMiB: 8192
              metadata: {}
              network:
                devices:
                - addressesFromPools:
                  - group: ipamcontroller.example.io
                    name: static-ci-pool
                    resource: IPPool
                  nameservers:
                  - "192.168.204.1"
                  networkName: qe-segment-204
              numCPUs: 4
              numCoresPerSocket: 2
              snapshot: ""
              template: rvanderp4-dev-9n5wg-rhcos-generated-region-generated-zone
              userDataSecret:
                name: worker-user-data
              workspace:
                datacenter: IBMCdatacenter
                datastore: /IBMCdatacenter/datastore/vsanDatastore
                folder: /IBMCdatacenter/vm/rvanderp4-dev-9n5wg
                resourcePool: /IBMCdatacenter/host/IBMCcluster//Resources
                server: vcenter.ibmc.devcluster.openshift.com
    ```

    - Specifies an IP pool, which lists a static IP address or a range of static IP addresses. The IP Pool can either be a reference to a custom resource definition (CRD) or a resource supported by the `IPAddressClaims` resource handler. The machine controller accesses static IP addresses listed in the machine set’s configuration and then allocates each address to each machine.

    - Lists a nameserver. You must specify a nameserver for nodes that receive static IP address, because the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) network configuration does not support static IP addresses.

2.  Scale the machine set by entering the following commands in your `oc` CLI:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
    ```

    Or:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
    ```

    After each machine is scaled up, the machine controller creates an `IPAddressClaim` resource.

3.  Optional: Check that the `IPAddressClaim` resource exists in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get ipaddressclaims.ipam.cluster.x-k8s.io -n openshift-machine-api
    ```

    <div class="formalpara">

    <div class="title">

    Example `oc` CLI output that lists two IP pools listed in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    NAME                                         POOL NAME        POOL KIND
    cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0   static-ci-pool   IPPool
    cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-wdqkt-claim-0-0   static-ci-pool   IPPool
    ```

    </div>

4.  Create an `IPAddress` resource by entering the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create -f ipaddress.yaml
    ```

    The following example shows an `IPAddress` resource with defined network configuration information and one defined static IP address:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: ipam.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
    kind: IPAddress
    metadata:
      name: cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-ipaddress-0-0
      namespace: openshift-machine-api
    spec:
      address: 192.168.204.129
      claimRef:
        name: cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0
      gateway: 192.168.204.1
      poolRef:
        apiGroup: ipamcontroller.example.io
        kind: IPPool
        name: static-ci-pool
      prefix: 23
    ```

    - The name of the target `IPAddressClaim` resource.

    - Details information about the static IP address or addresses from your nodes.

      > [!NOTE]
      > By default, the external controller automatically scans any resources in the machine set for recognizable address pool types. When the external controller finds `kind: IPPool` defined in the `IPAddress` resource, the controller binds any static IP addresses to the `IPAddressClaim` resource.

5.  Update the `IPAddressClaim` status with a reference to the `IPAddress` resource:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc --type=merge patch IPAddressClaim cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0 -p='{"status":{"addressRef": {"name": "cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-ipaddress-0-0"}}}' -n openshift-machine-api --subresource=status
    ```
