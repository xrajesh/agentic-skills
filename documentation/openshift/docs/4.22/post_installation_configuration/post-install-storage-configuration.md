After installing OpenShift Container Platform, you can further expand and customize your cluster to your requirements, including storage configuration.

By default, containers operate by using the ephemeral storage or transient local storage. The ephemeral storage has a lifetime limitation. To store the data for a long time, you must configure persistent storage. You can configure storage by using one of the following methods:

Dynamic provisioning
You can dynamically provision storage on-demand by defining and creating storage classes that control different levels of storage, including storage access.

Static provisioning
You can use Kubernetes persistent volumes to make existing storage available to a cluster. Static provisioning can support various device configurations and mount options.

# Dynamic provisioning

Dynamic Provisioning allows you to create storage volumes on-demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage. See [Dynamic provisioning](../storage/dynamic-provisioning.xml#dynamic-provisioning).

# Recommended configurable storage technology

Review the recommended and configurable storage technologies for the given OpenShift Container Platform cluster application.

| Storage type          | Block            | File             | Object           |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| ROX                   | Yes              | Yes              | Yes              |
| RWX                   | No               | Yes              | Yes              |
| Registry              | Configurable     | Configurable     | Recommended      |
| Scaled registry       | Not configurable | Configurable     | Recommended      |
| Metrics               | Recommended      | Configurable     | Not configurable |
| Elasticsearch Logging | Recommended      | Configurable     | Not supported    |
| Loki Logging          | Not configurable | Not configurable | Recommended      |
| Apps                  | Recommended      | Recommended      | Not configurable |

Recommended and configurable storage technology

where:

`ROX`
Specifies `ReadOnlyMany` access mode.

`ROX.Yes`
Specifies that this access mode

`RWX`
Specifies `ReadWriteMany` access mode.

`Metrics`
Specifies Prometheus as the underlying technology used for metrics.

`Metrics.Configurable`
For metrics, using file storage with the `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode is unreliable. If you use file storage, do not configure the RWX access mode on any persistent volume claims (PVCs) that are configured for use with metrics.

`Elasticsearch Logging.Configurable`
For logging, review the recommended storage solution in Configuring persistent storage for the log store section. Using NFS storage as a persistent volume or through NAS, such as Gluster, can corrupt the data. Therefore, NFS is not supported for Elasticsearch storage and LokiStack log store in OpenShift Container Platform Logging. You must use one persistent volume type per log store.

`Apps.Not configurable`
Specifies that object storage is not consumed through PVs or PVCs of OpenShift Container Platform. Apps must integrate with the object storage REST API.

> [!NOTE]
> A scaled registry is an OpenShift image registry where two or more pod replicas are running.

# Deploy Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation

Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is a provider of agnostic persistent storage for OpenShift Container Platform supporting file, block, and object storage, either in-house or in hybrid clouds. As a Red Hat storage solution, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is completely integrated with OpenShift Container Platform for deployment, management, and monitoring. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OpenShift Data Foundation on top of Red Hat Hyperconverged Infrastructure (RHHI) for Virtualization, which uses hyperconverged nodes that host virtual machines installed with OpenShift Container Platform, is not a supported configuration. For more information about supported platforms, see the [Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Supportability and Interoperability Guide](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4731161).
