# Understanding the CA Bundle certificate

Proxy certificates allow users to specify one or more custom certificate authority (CA) used by platform components when making egress connections.

The `trustedCA` field of the Proxy object is a reference to a config map that contains a user-provided trusted certificate authority (CA) bundle. This bundle is merged with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle and injected into the trust store of platform components that make egress HTTPS calls. For example, `image-registry-operator` calls an external image registry to download images. If `trustedCA` is not specified, only the RHCOS trust bundle is used for proxied HTTPS connections. Provide custom CA certificates to the RHCOS trust bundle if you want to use your own certificate infrastructure.

The `trustedCA` field should only be consumed by a proxy validator. The validator is responsible for reading the certificate bundle from required key `ca-bundle.crt` and copying it to a config map named `trusted-ca-bundle` in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace. The namespace for the config map referenced by `trustedCA` is `openshift-config`:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-ca-bundle
  namespace: openshift-config
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    Custom CA certificate bundle.
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Procedure

</div>

1.  Create a config map that includes the root CA certificate used to sign the wildcard certificate:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc create configmap custom-ca \
         --from-file=ca-bundle.crt=</path/to/example-ca.crt> \
         -n openshift-config
    ```

    - `</path/to/example-ca.crt>` is the path to the CA certificate bundle on your local file system.

2.  Update the cluster-wide proxy configuration with the newly created config map:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc patch proxy/cluster \
         --type=merge \
         --patch='{"spec":{"trustedCA":{"name":"custom-ca"}}}'
    ```
