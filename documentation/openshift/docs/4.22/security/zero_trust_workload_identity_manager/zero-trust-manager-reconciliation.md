<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To pause Operator reconciliation, enable `create-only` mode by setting an environment variable in the subscription object. By setting this value, you can perform manual configurations or debug the operator without the controller overwriting your changes.

</div>

The following scenarios are examples of when the `create-only` mode might be of use:

**Manual Customization Required**: You need to customize operator-managed resources (ConfigMaps, Deployments, DaemonSets, etc.) with specific configurations that differ from the operator’s defaults

**Day 2 Operations**: After initial deployment, you want to prevent the operator from overwriting their manual changes during subsequent reconciliation cycles

**Configuration Drift Prevention**: You want to maintain control over certain resource configurations while still benefiting from the operator’s lifecycle management

# Pausing Operator reconciliation

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

Pause reconciliation of the operands by enabling `create-only` mode. This setting prevents the Operator from automatically reverting your manual changes to the desired state. You can enable this mode by updating the Operator’s subscription object.

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When `create-only` mode is disabled, the Operator overwrites the resources if any conflicts exist.

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have installed Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager on your machine.

- You have installed the SPIRE Servers, Agents, SPIFFE Container Storage Interface (CSI), and an OpenID Connect (OIDC) Discovery Provider and are in running status.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

- To pause reconciling the operands resources managed by the Operator, add the environment variable `CREATE_ONLY_MODE`: `true` in the subscription object by running the following command:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc -n $OPERATOR_NAMESPACE patch subscription openshift-zero-trust-workload-identity-manager --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"config":{"env":[{"name":"CREATE_ONLY_MODE","value":"true"}]}}}'
  ```

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Verification

</div>

- Check the status of the `SpireServer` resource to confirm that the `create-only` mode is active. The `status` must be `true` and the `reason` must be `CreateOnlyModeEnabled`.

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get SpireServer cluster -o yaml
  ```

  The following is an example that confirms that the 'create-only' mode is active.

</div>

    status:
      conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2025-12-23T11:36:58Z"
        message: All components are ready
        reason: Ready
        status: "True"
        type: Ready
      - lastTransitionTime: "2025-12-23T11:36:58Z"
        message: All operand CRs are ready
        reason: Ready
        status: "True"
        type: OperandsAvailable
      - lastTransitionTime: "2025-12-23T11:36:58Z"
        message: create-only mode enabled
        reason: CreateOnlyModeEnabled
        status: "True"
        type: CreateOnlyMode

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Operator updates the upgradeable condition to `false` in the `operatorCondition` resource. You might not be able to upgrade the Operator when in `create-only` mode.

# Resuming Operator reconciliation

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To resume Operator reconciliation after manual configuration or debugging, disable the `create-only` mode. This allows the controller to resume managing resources and applying the desired state. You can disable this mode by setting the environment variable in the subscription object.

</div>

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have enabled `create-only` mode on the Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager.

- You have completed your manual configuration or debugging tasks.

Procedure

</div>

- To restart reconciling the Operator-managed resources, add the environment variable `CREATE_ONLY_MODE`: `false` in the subscription object by running the following command:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc -n $OPERATOR_NAMESPACE patch subscription openshift-zero-trust-workload-identity-manager --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"config":{"env":[{"name":"CREATE_ONLY_MODE","value":"false"}]}}}'
