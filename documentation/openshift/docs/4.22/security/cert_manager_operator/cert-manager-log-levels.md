# Setting a log level for cert-manager

<div wrapper="1" role="_abstract">

To troubleshoot issues and control log volume, configure the log level for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. You can set specific verbosity levels to capture the necessary details for debugging or to reduce noise in your cluster logs.

</div>

<div>

<div class="title">

Prerequisites

</div>

- You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.

- You have installed version 1.11.1 or later of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

</div>

<div class="title">

Procedure

</div>

1.  Edit the `CertManager` resource by running the following command:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit certmanager.operator cluster
    ```

2.  Set the log level value by editing the `spec.logLevel` section:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: CertManager
    ...
    spec:
      logLevel: <log_level>
    ```

    The valid log level values for the `CertManager` resource are `Normal`, `Debug`, `Trace`, and `TraceAll`. To audit logs and perform common operations when there are no issues, set `logLevel` to `Normal` . To troubleshoot a minor issue by viewing verbose logs, set `logLevel` to `Debug` . To troubleshoot a major issue by viewing more verbose logs, you can set `logLevel` to `Trace`. To troubleshoot serious issues, set `logLevel` to `TraceAll`. The default `logLevel` is `Normal`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > `TraceAll` generates huge amount of logs. After setting `logLevel` to `TraceAll`, you might experience performance issues.

3.  Save your changes and quit the text editor to apply your changes.

    After applying the changes, the verbosity level for the cert-manager components controller, CA injector, and webhook is updated.
